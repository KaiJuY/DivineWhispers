    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對未來道路的無法預知與持續的紛爭。詩中「一重江水一重山」形象地描繪前行的路程如同先須橫渡江流，再攀登高山，障礙重重。作者用「誰知此去路又難」表明即使努力改變方向，仍難以避開未知的困難。最後兩句「任他改求終不過 / 是非終久未得安」說明不斷追求變化與解決，仍難以獲得心靜與安寧。詩人提示，唯有放下對結果的執著，接受無法掌控的事實，才能在混亂中尋得一絲平靜。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the uncertainty and persistent discord of future paths. The lines 'one layer of river, one layer of mountain' vividly depict a journey that must first cross a river and then climb a mountain, obstacles abound. The poet expresses that even if one changes direction, unknown difficulties cannot be avoided. The_DESCRIPTIVE_LAST_LINES suggest that continuous attempts at change and resolution still fail to bring inner peace. The poem advises that only by letting go of fixation on outcomes and accepting the uncontrollable nature of events can one find a glimmer of calm amid chaos.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは未来の道の予測不能と継続的な争いです。『一重江水一重山』という行は、進む道がまず川を渡り、その後山を登るように描かれ、障害が重なることを示しています。詩人は、方向を変えても未知の困難を避けることができないと表現しています。最後の二行は、変化と解決を続けても内なる平和を得ることができないと示唆しています。詩は、結果への執着を手放し、制御できない事実を受け入れることで混乱の中に少しの安らぎを見つけることができると助言しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the path ahead is shrouded in uncertainty and persistent conflict, and no matter how one attempts to alter the course, lasting peace remains elusive. The poem warns that the external world is fraught with hidden obstacles that cannot be foreseen, and that relentless pursuit of resolution may lead to exhaustion rather than solace. It invites the reader to accept the limits of control, cultivate inner resilience, and seek peace through self‑reflection rather than external change.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s emphasis on unforeseen difficulties mirrors the unpredictable nature of health. While medical treatments can be altered, the underlying uncertainties of illness remain. Therefore, maintaining a balanced lifestyle and a calm mind may mitigate the anxiety that arises from uncontrollable health events.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – In matters of affection, the lines suggest that constant adjustments to solve quarrels seldom bring lasting harmony. Couples should therefore focus on mutual understanding and acceptance rather than pursuing external fixes. Cultivating patience can reduce the cycle of conflict and foster deeper intimacy.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The journey described—crossing a river then climbing a mountain—parallels the obstacles in professional life. Even with strategic changes, unforeseen setbacks can derail progress. Success is more sustainable when one aligns personal goals with inner resilience, rather than chasing every external opportunity.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The poem’s refrain of “is it not difficult” reflects the unpredictability of financial markets and personal earnings. Constantly shifting strategies may lead to loss and frustration. A prudent approach involves steady planning, risk management, and accepting that some financial outcomes are beyond complete control.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Family relationships often echo the poem’s theme of unresolved disputes. Efforts to modify family dynamics may not yield lasting tranquility. Instead, fostering empathy, open communication, and internal acceptance can strengthen familial bonds and create a stable home environment.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Social networks can mirror the hidden obstacles depicted in the poem. Attempts to shape public perception may leave one exhausted without true approval. Building genuine connections based on authenticity and resilience can preserve reputation even amid inevitable social friction.",
