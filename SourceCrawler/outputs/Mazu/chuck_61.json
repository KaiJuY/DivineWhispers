    "en": "This poem’s theme is the interaction between favorable circumstances and inner disposition that leads to good fortune and well‑being. The first line uses the moon’s bright, clear light to symbolize integrity and smooth progress, suggesting that a clear heart brings success; the second line notes that clouds cover the sky, hinting at hidden difficulties yet not permanent, reminding us to stay alert; the third line stresses that sincere effort and benevolence create personal blessings, implying that practice and good deeds enrich life; the fourth line states that holding a public office or taking responsibility, if conducted with fairness and effectiveness, also yields benefit and social value. In sum, the poem urges that in good times we should still cultivate ourselves and practice virtue, and in hard times maintain uprightness, thereby attaining lasting wealth, health and longevity.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、好機と内面的な姿勢の相互作用によって生まれる吉祥と福祉についてです。第一行は月光の輝きと清澄さで正直さと順調さを象徴し、心が澄んでいれば幸運が来ることを示唆します。第二行は雲が覆い隠す暗さを示し、潜在的な困難を示唆しますが、永遠ではなく警戒を促します。第三行は真摯な努力と善行が個人的な福徳を創造し、実践と善行が人生を豊かにすると示唆します。第四行は公職を担う、または責任を負う場合、公正と効率をもって行えば利益と社会的価値がもたらされると述べています。総合すると、詩は順調な時に自分を磨き善行を実践し、困難な時は正直であるべきであると訴え、長期的な富と健康と長寿を得ることを促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that celestial beauty and earthly diligence intertwine to shape a life of harmony, responsibility, and prosperity. The waxing moon represents pure, unobstructed intention, while the drifting clouds remind us that obstacles are transient and require vigilance. Inner sincerity and benevolent action are portrayed as self‑created blessings, suggesting that personal cultivation and altruism directly influence one’s fortunes. The final line emphasizes that assuming public office or responsibility, when approached with fairness and efficiency, yields both personal benefit and societal good. This holistic view encourages the seeker to maintain integrity during favorable times and uphold uprightness during adversity, thereby cultivating long‑lasting wealth, health, and longevity.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s depiction of a bright, unclouded moon implies mental clarity and vitality; by cultivating a calm and sincere mind, one can protect physical well‑being and prevent illness. Moreover, the call to “use inner care” suggests regular self‑check and disciplined habits as foundations of robust health.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The imagery of clouds concealing the sky warns that misunderstandings may arise, yet the poet’s reminder of “inner sincerity” highlights the importance of honest communication and empathy to clear any fog in relationships, fostering deeper bonds.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The fourth line explicitly links responsible governance to beneficial outcomes. It advises pursuing professional roles with ethical intent, efficiency, and public service; such conduct not only promotes personal advancement but also cultivates a reputation for integrity.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Wealth is portrayed as a natural consequence of “pure intention” and “benevolent deeds.” Thus, prudent financial decisions grounded in ethical considerations—such as responsible budgeting, charity, and fair trade—can lead to sustainable prosperity.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The poem urges continuous self‑cultivation and benevolence, which translate into nurturing family environments. By fostering patience, kindness, and open dialogue at home, one can build a harmonious household that supports collective growth.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The concluding admonition that public duty brings benefits emphasizes the power of a positive social reputation. By acting justly and effectively in communal roles, one builds trust, earns respect, and strengthens networks essential for long‑term influence and success.",
