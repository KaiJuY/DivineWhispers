    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於在追尋命運道路時，保持寬闊心胸，暫時放下執著，靜待貴人相助。詩中提到「意中若問神仙路」與「勸爾且退望高樓」兩句，既顯示人對未來的不確定，也提醒人要把心從執著中釋放，學會像站在高樓遠眺般寬闊。接著「寬心且守寬心坐」表達在靜坐中保持寬容，將內在煩惱化為寧靜的風景；最後「必然遇得貴人扶」則是對未來的肯定，預示只要保持內心寬闊，命運之門將會有貴人推開。整首詩以「意中若問神仙路」為起點，將追尋命運與心態調整相結合，傳遞出以寬闊心胸等待貴人相助的正面訊息。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that one should cultivate a wide and patient heart while navigating the uncertainties of fate, trusting that supportive benefactors will eventually arrive. The opening line, \"意中若問神仙路,\" implies a desire to consult divine guidance, setting the stage for the poem’s counsel to step back and observe the path from a higher perspective, as suggested by \"勸爾且退望高樓.\" The third line, \"寬心且守寬心坐,\" emphasizes the importance of maintaining inner spaciousness and calm through mindful practice, while the final line, \"必然遇得貴人扶,\" offers assurance that by steadfastly upholding this state, one will inevitably encounter the assistance of a benevolent figure.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem encourages mental clarity and tranquility, which are essential for physical well‑being. By practicing patience and letting go of obsessive desires, stress diminishes, allowing the body to recover and thrive. A calm mind also supports healthy decision‑making, such as choosing balanced nutrition and regular exercise.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – Maintaining an open heart fosters compassion toward others, enhancing intimacy and trust. When one steps back and observes rather than demanding, partners feel respected, which nurtures deeper emotional bonds. The promise of a benefactor suggests that kindness and patience will be rewarded with supportive companionship.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The poem’s advice to \"退望高樓\" mirrors the strategic retreat in professional life: pause to assess long‑term goals, rather than rushing toward immediate gains. By holding a spacious mindset, one remains receptive to mentorship and opportunities that a \"貴人\" may present, thereby advancing skill development and career trajectory.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Financial stability is bolstered by patience and restraint. Avoiding impulsive spending and seeking wise counsel echo the poem’s message that a benefactor will eventually assist in building prosperity. A calm, measured approach to investments also reduces risk.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – A wide‑hearted stance encourages understanding within family dynamics. By observing issues from a higher perspective, one can mediate conflicts peacefully, fostering harmony and mutual support. The notion of a benevolent helper also suggests that family unity will grow stronger through shared compassion.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The poem underlines the virtue of humility and patience in building social networks. Stepping back allows one to notice others’ strengths and create genuine alliances. The assurance of a benefactor reinforces the idea that reputational goodwill will attract helpful allies and open doors to future collaborations.",
