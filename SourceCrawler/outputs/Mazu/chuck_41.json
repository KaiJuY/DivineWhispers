    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於目前境況的難以推動與未來轉機的暗示。第一句『今行到此實難推』表明在當下已經走到了無法回頭的地步，暗示過去的行為已經把路徑鎖定。第二句『歌歌暢飲自徘徊』雖描繪歡樂，但隱含作者在快樂中仍停滯不前，呈現出心中矛盾與徬徨。第三句『雞犬相聞消息近』以傳統吉祥之象，預示即將有關鍵訊息傳來，像是「雞犬相聞」的契機，提醒時機將至。第四句『婚姻夙世結成雙』則將此訊息投射至人際關係，暗示若是緣定，將自然而然走向結合。整首詩以象徵與比喻相結合，勸人審視自身過去行為，因為只有在理解與接受這些經驗後，才可能把握未來的機會。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the difficulty of moving forward in the present situation and the hint of an upcoming turning point. The first line, \"Now at this point it is truly hard to push ahead,\" indicates that one has already reached a point where one cannot backtrack, suggesting that past actions have fixed the path. The second line, \"Singing and drinking freely while still wandering,\" describes a joyful scene yet reveals the author’s hesitation and inner conflict, highlighting a state of indecision. The third line, \"The rooster and dog will hear each other soon,\" uses a traditional auspicious symbol to foretell that key information will arrive, as the \"rooster‑and‑dog\" moment approaches, reminding that the time is coming. The fourth line, \"Marriage will naturally unite those who were destined in a previous life,\" projects the message onto interpersonal relationships, implying that if the bond is fated, it will naturally lead to union. Overall, the poem blends symbolism and metaphor, urging the reader to reflect on past deeds, for only by understanding and accepting these experiences can one grasp the opportunities ahead.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、現在の状況で前進することの難しさと、近づく転換点の兆しです。最初の行『今行到此実難推』は、もう後戻りできない地点に到達したことを示し、過去の行動が道を定めたことを暗示します。第二の行『歌歌暢飲自徘徊』は、楽しみながらもまだ迷っている様子を描き、内面の葛藤と迷いを表します。第三の行『雞犬相聞消息近』は、伝統的な吉兆の象徴で、重要な情報が近づいてくることを予告し、『鶏犬相聞』の時が来ることを知らせます。第四の行『婚姻夙世結成雙』は、運命に結ばれた者は自然に結婚へと導かれると示し、対人関係へのメッセージを投げかけます。全体として、象徴と比喩を組み合わせ、読者に過去の行いを振り返らせることで、未来の機会を掴むために理解と受容が必要であると促します。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the seeker has reached a point in life where further progress is impeded by past actions, yet a significant change is imminent as indicated by the symbolic 'rooster‑and‑dog' omen. The verses combine a sense of hesitation in the present with an auspicious anticipation of forthcoming information, and suggest that if the relationships involved are destined, they will naturally resolve into partnership. Thus the poem invites introspection on one's history and readiness to accept the opportunity that will arise. 1. Health – The poem’s notion of being “stuck” implies that one should examine habits that may be hindering vitality. A disciplined routine, coupled with mindful rest, can break the inertia expressed in the first line. The hopeful arrival of the “rooster‑and‑dog” signal reminds that recovery often comes when we listen to subtle cues from our environment. 2. Love and Relationships – The closing line explicitly references a destined marriage. Couples who have remained uncertain can interpret this as an encouragement to communicate openly, letting mutual understanding replace hesitation. For singles, the verse suggests that genuine partnership may come when one is ready to let past doubts fade. 3. Career and Ambition – The inability to “push ahead” echoes career stagnation. Reflecting on past decisions and correcting missteps can create a new path. Anticipating the “coming message” signals a forthcoming opportunity, urging readiness to seize a promotion or project when it materializes. 4. Wealth and Finances – While the poem does not directly mention money, the metaphor of “drinking freely” hints at indulgence. Moderating spending and saving can prevent the feeling of being trapped. The omen implies that prudent financial planning can bring a sudden influx, symbolized by the rooster‑and‑dog’s harmony. 5. Family and Harmony – The imagery of the rooster and dog hearing each other promotes harmony in domestic life. Resolving lingering conflicts and embracing open dialogue can transform stagnant family dynamics. The verse’s promise of a natural union suggests that patience and mutual respect lead to lasting harmony. 6. Social Connections and Reputation – The “rooster‑and‑dog” cue also serves as a reminder to be attentive to social signals. Building trustworthy relationships and maintaining a clear reputation can create moments where opportunities align. Acknowledging past mistakes and learning from them can reestablish credibility, allowing the next positive wave to arrive.",
