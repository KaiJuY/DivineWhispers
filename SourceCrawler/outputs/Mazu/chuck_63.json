    "en": "This poem's theme is about acquiring fortune through sincere work and inner cultivation, accumulating blessings and virtue to ultimately achieve peace and prosperity. The first line uses the moon's bright clarity to symbolize purity and good fortune, hinting at a favorable start; the second line, with clouds covering, reflects worldly changes and challenges, reminding one to stay alert. The third line emphasizes the inner care of the household and heart, pointing out that blessings stem from diligent and generous inner devotion. The final line explains that, as a public servant, handling affairs with integrity and diligence can bring real benefits and social reward. This poem resonates with the accompanying fortune text, “Adding a branch to the sixty-year cycle, seeking divine counsel for the future, blessing more children and longevity, and ensuring wealth and honor will protect you,” integrating personal cultivation, family blessings, and societal roles, urging readers to act honestly and uprightly toward the future.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、真摯な仕事と内面の修養を通じて福祉と善行を蓄え、最終的に安寧と栄光を得ることです。最初の句では、月の光の明澈さが純粋な吉祥を象徴し、良い始まりを示唆しています。次の句では雲が陰を覆い、世間の変化と挑戦を映し出し、警戒を促します。三番目の句は、家庭と心の内面のケアを強調し、善行と福祉は内なる勤勉と寛大さから生まれると指摘します。最後の句は、公務員として正直と勤勉で政務を分担すれば、実際の利益と社会的報酬を得られると説明しています。詩は付録の「六十甲子に枝を加え、未来を神の先知に尋ね、子どもと長寿を増やし、富と栄光があなたを守る」というメッセージと調和し、個人の修養、家庭の福祉、社会的役割を一体化し、読者に誠実さと正直さを持って未来へ進むよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that a harmonious blend of inner virtue, diligent work, and responsible public service leads to lasting blessings and social esteem. The verses use the imagery of a clear moon to signal auspicious beginnings, while the ever‑present clouds remind the reader that external circumstances can obscure even the brightest light. The third line urges internal cultivation—care for one’s home and heart—as the foundation of lasting fortune. The final line elevates the role of public duty, asserting that honest administration of responsibilities yields tangible benefits for both the individual and the community. Together with the accompanying fortune line, the poem suggests a balanced path toward personal fulfillment, familial prosperity, and societal contribution.\n\n1. **Health**: The clear moon symbolizes clarity and purity, encouraging the practitioner to maintain mental clarity and physical well‑being. Consistent self‑care practices, such as mindful breathing or regular exercise, reinforce a resilient body capable of withstanding external pressures. By honoring one’s body, the seeker preserves the foundation for enduring prosperity.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships**: The line about clouds warns that obstacles may arise in intimate bonds. Remaining vigilant and communicating openly helps dissolve misunderstandings. Cultivating empathy and appreciation nurtures relationships that mirror the moon’s steady glow.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition**: The poem’s emphasis on diligent public service implies that integrity in professional duties yields genuine success. Setting clear goals, pursuing continuous learning, and treating tasks with earnestness ensure that ambition is rooted in ethical action. These principles secure advancement that benefits both self and community.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances**: The reference to “wealth and honor” underscores that true affluence stems from consistent effort and responsible stewardship. Wise budgeting, prudent investments, and generosity toward others create a sustainable financial ecosystem that reflects the poem’s balanced ethos.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony**: Caring for the household, as urged in the third stanza, translates to nurturing family bonds. Regular rituals—sharing meals, offering support, and expressing gratitude—fortify emotional security and create a nurturing home environment, fostering collective resilience.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation**: The call to manage public affairs with integrity highlights the importance of reputation. Voluntary community service, transparency in actions, and respectful collaboration cultivate a positive social standing that reinforces mutual trust and opens avenues for shared growth.",
