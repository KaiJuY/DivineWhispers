    "zh": "詩歌以姜太公八十而成事為典型，象徵事業成功並非必須早起，而是順其天命與時機。月光照四海的畫面，提醒人們只要保持信心與耐心，正如太公經歷長久磨練後終於見光。茅屋中之境況，提示當事人當先以節約、安居為主，避免奢華，並以清貧樂道作為心態。最終，詩意在於堅守本心，等待時機自會迎來順利與吉祥。在此詩中，月亮的光亮象徵機遇，暗示即使目前處於簡樸境地，只要堅持自我修養，終將迎來光明。",
    "en": "The poem uses Jiang Ziya achieving success at age eighty as a prototype, symbolizing that career success need not come early, but follows destiny and timing. The image of the moon shining over the four seas reminds people that as long as they remain patient and steadfast, like Jiang Ziya after long toil, they will eventually see light. The situation of dwelling in a hut advises the seeker to first practice frugality and settle, avoiding extravagance, and to view poverty as a path to tranquility. Ultimately, the poem urges one to keep true to oneself, waiting for the moment that will inevitably bring success and good fortune. In this poem, the moon’s brilliance symbolizes opportunity, indicating that even if one is currently in a simple state, by maintaining self-cultivation one will ultimately be greeted by brightness.",
    "jp": "この詩は姜太公が八十歳で成就したことを典型として、キャリアの成功は早期に求めるものではなく、運命と時機に従うべきだと示しています。月光が四海に照らすイメージは、人々に忍耐と信念を保つ限り、姜太公が長い修行の末に光を得たように、結局光を見出せることを思い起こさせます。茅屋に住む状態は、尋問者にまず節約と安定を重視し、贅沢を避け、貧困を心の平和へと変えるよう促します。結局、この詩は自分の心に忠実であり、機会を待つことで必ずや成功と幸運が訪れると説いています。この詩において、月の輝きは機会を象徴し、現在簡素な状態でも自己修養を続ければやがて明るい未来が訪れることを示唆しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that true success and good fortune come from aligning oneself with the natural flow of destiny, patience, and self‑discipline, rather than rushing for early achievements. The metaphor of the moon shining across the four seas suggests that once one remains steadfast, clarity and opportunity will eventually illuminate their path. The poet’s illustration of dwelling in a humble hut advises the seeker to embrace simplicity and moderation, cultivating inner peace while awaiting auspicious timing.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem encourages a calm, unhurried lifestyle, implying that by avoiding excess and maintaining steady routines, one can reduce stress and promote physical well‑being.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – By valuing patience and authenticity, the verses suggest nurturing bonds that are built on mutual respect and sincere support rather than haste or superficiality.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Success is portrayed as a late bloom; thus, long‑term dedication, learning, and perseverance are key, with the expectation that recognition will arrive when conditions are ripe.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Frugality is advocated; the poem advises to live within means, save, and avoid unnecessary extravagance, trusting that prudent management will yield prosperity over time.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The humble setting encourages a harmonious home life grounded in simplicity and cooperation, reinforcing that domestic peace is foundational to broader success.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The message underscores the importance of a steady, honorable presence in society; by acting with integrity and patience, one can earn respect and positive relationships that will support future endeavors.",
