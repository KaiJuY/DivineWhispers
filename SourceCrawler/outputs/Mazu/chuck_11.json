    "zh": "這首詩的主題是以『靈雞』為契機，透過時間（子、丑、寅）與天象（雲開月出）來預示事物的結局。詩中說到聽到雞啼即為天亮，暗示黎明前的黑暗將被照亮。子、丑、寅被視為關鍵時段，象徵事情在這個階段會有明確答案。雲散、月光照耀則喻示障礙消除，萬物得以平安。整體而言，詩歌強調適時、耐心與自然循環的重要，最終得到『見太平』的安定與祥和。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is that 'Spirit chicken' serves as a catalyst, using time (Zi, Chou, Yin) and celestial imagery (clouds dispersing, moon rising) to predict outcomes. The poem says that hearing the rooster indicates sunrise, implying the darkness before dawn will be illuminated. Zi, Chou, Yin are regarded as key periods, symbolizing that matters will have clear answers during this phase. The dispersal of clouds and moonlight symbolize obstacle removal and universal peace. Overall, the poem emphasizes the importance of timeliness, patience, and natural cycles, ultimately achieving 'peace' and harmony.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは『霊鶏』を契機として、時間（子、丑、寅）と天象（雲が散り、月が昇る）を使い、事物の結末を予示することです。詩では鶏の鳴き声を聞くと朝が来ると述べており、夜明け前の暗闇が照らされることを暗示しています。子、丑、寅は重要な時期と見なされ、この段階で事柄に明確な答えが出ることを象徴しています。雲の散り、月光の照射は障害の除去と万物の平安を象徴します。全体として、詩は適時性、忍耐、自然の循環の重要性を強調し、最終的に『太平』という安定と調和を得ることを示しています。",
