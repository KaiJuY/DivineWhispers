    "en": "This poem's theme is the power of perseverance and faith. In the poem, the image of sw*/, swearing before Buddha illustrates that as long as one remains steadfast and unchanged in mind, good fortune will come. Iron symbolizes current difficulties, which can turn into gold through relentless effort, indicating the transformation of material and spirit. The poem emphasizes the importance of firm will and perseverance, reminding that when facing obstacles one must keep faith to usher in a bright future. The lines \"Swear before Buddha without wavering\" suggest purity of faith and promise; \"Look forward to the good news\" signals the bright return. Finally, \"What is originally iron can become gold\" uses iron turning to gold as a metaphor, showing that although circumstances are limited, perseverance will ultimately bring success and wealth. Overall, the poem conveys that steadfast faith and sustained effort are key to breaking constraints and creating a better future.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、忍耐と信念の力です。詩では、仏前で誓いを立てるイメージが、心を変えずに堅持すれば、良い運がやってくることを示しています。鉄は現在の困難を象徴し、絶え間ない努力で金に変わる可能性があり、物質的・精神的な変化を示唆しています。詩は、強い意思と粘り強さの重要性を強調し、障害に直面したときに信念を保つことが明るい未来を迎える鍵であると戒めています。「仏前で揺らがずに誓う」には、信仰と約束の純粋さが示され、「良いニュースを見つめる」は明るい帰還を示唆します。最後に「本来鉄は金に変わる」では、鉄が金に変わる比喩を用いて、状況が限られていても、粘り強さが最終的に成功と富をもたらすことを示しています。全体として、この詩は、揺るがぬ信念と持続的な努力が、制約を突破しより良い未来を創造する鍵であることを伝えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a celebration of steadfast faith and the transformative power of perseverance. The first line, “Swear before Buddha without wavering,” evokes a solemn vow that is pure, sincere, and unchanging. It underscores the importance of maintaining a fixed intention and a steady heart. The second line, “Look forward to the good news,” promises that such steadfastness will be rewarded with favorable outcomes. The final couplet uses the metaphor of iron turning into gold to illustrate how an initially humble or problematic situation can, through relentless effort, evolve into something valuable and successful. Together, these images suggest that perseverance is a catalyst that can turn material and spiritual limitations into prosperity and brighter futures. The poem’s message is therefore clear: unwavering faith coupled with continuous, disciplined effort is the key to breaking through present constraints and forging a brighter tomorrow.\n\n1. **Faith as a guiding compass** – The act of swearing before Buddha highlights the role of faith as a steadfast compass that keeps one oriented toward the right path.\n\n2. **Consistency of intention** – The insistence on not changing one’s heart or intention stresses the need for a continuous, unaltered commitment.\n\n3. **Transformation of adversity into opportunity** – The imagery of iron being turned into gold symbolizes how current difficulties can become opportunities when approached with perseverance.\n\n4. **Reward of perseverance** – The line about hearing good news indicates that steadfastness will eventually lead to positive outcomes, whether they be emotional, material, or spiritual.\n\n5. **Inner resilience as a key resource** – The poem reminds the reader that obstacles are only temporary and that keeping faith in the face of adversity is essential for overcoming them.\n\n6. **Long‑term vision of success** – By showing that iron can become gold, the poem encourages a long‑term view, suggesting that patience and effort over time can yield tangible rewards and wealth.\n\nOverall, the poem can be read as a meditation on the inner qualities—faith, resolve, and disciplined persistence—that enable a person to transcend the limitations of the present moment and to cultivate a future filled with prosperity, harmony, and personal fulfilment.",
