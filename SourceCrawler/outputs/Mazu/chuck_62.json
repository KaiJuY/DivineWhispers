    "en": "The theme of this poem is the cultivation of inner virtue and the conduct in public office. The opening line, \"The moon rises with bright light, inherent goodness,\" uses the bright moon to liken a heart’s innate righteousness and benevolence, implying a divine sense of integrity. The second line, \"Floating clouds always cover the shadows,\" reveals that external difficulties and darkness often obscure the heart, reminding us to remain vigilant and overcome obstacles. The third line, \"Within the household, sincere effort creates fortune,\" emphasizes that internal diligence and goodwill are the foundation of prosperity, urging sincere dedication in daily life and work. The final line, \"When in office, fair administration brings benefit,\" points out that, in holding a public role or social responsibility, one can bring tangible benefit and welfare to oneself and others if one acts with sincerity and integrity. Overall, the poem encourages first self‑cultivation, then social engagement, stressing that sustained effort and righteousness lead to mutual gains for both individuals and society.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、内面の修養と公職における行為についてです。冒頭の「月が光り輝き、清い吉を示す」は、明るい月を比喩して、人心の内なる正義と善意を象徴し、天から授けられた正直さと善念を示唆しています。第二句の「浮雲は常に陰色を覆う」は、外部の困難や闇が心を覆い隠すことを明らかにし、警戒心と障害克服の重要性を思い出させます。第三句の「家庭内で真心を尽くし福を作る」は、内面的な努力と善意が富を創造する根本であることを強調し、日常生活や仕事への誠実な献身を促します。最後の句の「官職に就けば、公正な行政が利益をもたらす」は、公務や社会的責任を担う際に、誠意と正直さをもって行動すれば、自分と他者に具体的な利益と福祉をもたらすことができると指摘しています。全体として、詩はまず自らを修め、次に社会に関わることを奨励し、継続的な努力と正義こそが個人と社会の両方にとって双方向の利益をもたらすと強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem,({'core meaning is that true prosperity originates from inner virtue and diligent effort, and that responsible public conduct amplifies personal and communal benefits. The verses depict a progression from innate goodness symbolized by the moon’s light, through external obstacles represented by drifting clouds, to the decisive role of personal devotion in cultivating fortune, and finally the moral responsibility of those in authority to administer justice and secure collective welfare. The poem therefore urges individuals to nurture self‑discipline, confront external challenges, and exercise integrity in both private and public realms.} \n\nHealth: The poem’s imagery of a clear, bright moon implies a harmonious and balanced state of being; maintaining mental calm and clarity supports physical vitality. Attending to the “floating clouds” reminds one to address hidden stresses that may cloud health, encouraging proactive self‑care and regular medical check‑ups. By fostering inner sincerity, one cultivates resilience that sustains overall wellbeing.\n\nLove and Relationships: The poem stresses inner dedication as the bedrock of fortune; applying this to personal bonds means investing genuine effort and empathy. Just as the moon’s light penetrates darkness, partners who illuminate each other’s lives can dissolve misunderstandings. Consistent, heartfelt engagement nurtures trust, harmony, and lasting affection.\n\nCareer and Ambition: The passage that \"when in office, fair administration brings benefit\" advises professionals to pursue excellence through integrity. A disciplined work ethic rooted in inner virtue attracts recognition and opens doors to advancement. Those who treat responsibilities with sincerity are likely to achieve long‑term success and career satisfaction.\n\nWealth and Finances: Prosperity emerges from \"within the household, sincere effort creates fortune\"; diligent budgeting, ethical investing, and persistent savings build financial security. The poem cautions against complacency, urging continual effort to overcome obstacles that can impede wealth accumulation. Transparency and honesty in financial dealings further ensure sustainable growth.\n\nFamily and Harmony: The poem advocates internal cultivation as the foundation for familial blessings; parents who nurture self‑discipline model responsibility for children. By confronting \"floating clouds\"—conflicts or misunderstandings—families can maintain peace. Dedicated household stewardship promotes a nurturing environment where love and mutual respect flourish.\n\nSocial Connections and Reputation: Public conduct matters; the poem’s final line signals that integrity in public roles enhances one’s reputation and benefits others. Engaging in community service, listening to peers, and acting justly strengthen social bonds. A reputation built on trust and sincerity invites opportunities, collaboration, and lasting influence.",
