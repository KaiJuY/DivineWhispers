    "en": "The theme of this poem is to remind the inquirer that unresolved grudges and unresolved family crises still linger in the heart; if not faced, they may still bring disaster. Even though domestic calamities have not directly afflicted oneself, caution must still be exercised, and accumulating virtue through good deeds is a means to mitigate latent risks. Finally, when the ‘meeting of dragon and snake’ occurs, perplexing matters will yield a clear outcome, symbolizing that issues will ultimately be clarified and resolved. The line ‘old grievances stack upon each other and remain unresolved’ implies that past resentments have not been released and still accumulate in the mind. ‘The calamity in the family does not strike oneself’ reminds the inquirer that although disasters do not directly affect oneself, careless neglect may still cause them to manifest. ‘One must exercise caution and create good fortune’ stresses the importance of vigilance and adopting virtuous deeds as a preventive strategy. Finally, the phrase ‘the dragon and snake meet to achieve harmony’ symbolizes that when dragon and snake encounter each other, chaos will be reconciled and concluded; it can also be understood as a turning point at a certain time or the start of a year, bringing calmness and problem resolution.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、未解決の恨みと未だに解消されていない家庭の危機が心に残っていることを求め者に警告し、過去の問題に正面から向き合い、慎重に防備を強め、善行で福徳を積み重ねることを促すものです。詩中の『旧恨重重未改為』は、過去の憤りがまだ手放せず心に蓄積していることを示唆し、『家中禍患不臨身』は、災いが直接本人に襲わないにしても、注意が怠れば転じて降臨する可能性を示しています。さらに、『須當謹防宜作福』は、警戒心を持ち善行で善運を生む重要性を強調し、最後の『龍蛇交會得和合』は、龍と蛇が交わる時に混乱が和解し解決される転換点を象徴しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a reminder that unresolved grievances and potential domestic risks still linger, urging the seeker to confront past issues, practice diligent vigilance, accumulate virtuous deeds, and trust that the eventual convergence of dragon and snake will bring clarity and resolution.\n\n1. **Health** – The verse warns that emotional baggage left unresolved can subtly erode physical well‑being. By cultivating calmness through mindfulness, regular exercise, and periodic health check‑ups, one can protect against hidden ailments that may arise from accumulated stress. Maintaining a balanced diet and adequate sleep further reinforces this safeguard.\n\n2. **Finance** – Financial stability is linked to the concept of ‘作福’ (creating good fortune). Engaging in honest transactions, avoiding impulsive spending, and building a modest emergency fund mirror the accumulation of virtue suggested in the poem. Such prudent habits mitigate the risk of sudden financial loss, even if no immediate hardship is apparent.\n\n3. **Career** – In the workplace, unresolved past conflicts can cloud judgment and hinder progress. The poem’s emphasis on vigilance and virtuous conduct encourages professional integrity, collaborative problem‑solving, and continual skill development. Trusting that the ‘dragon‑snake meeting’ will eventually bring resolution can help maintain long‑term career satisfaction.\n\n4. **Relationships** – Lingering grudges may strain personal ties. The text’s warning that domestic calamities may not directly affect one yet could manifest later underscores the need for open communication and emotional reconciliation. By fostering empathy and offering support, individuals can preemptively ease relational tensions.\n\n5. **Personal Growth** – The idea of ‘龍蛇交會’ represents a turning point where chaos is reconciled. This symbolic convergence encourages the seeker to embrace change, let go of past resentment, and pursue self‑development. Continuous reflection, journaling, and setting achievable goals align with the poem’s guidance toward eventual harmony.\n\n6. **Spiritual Well‑being** – The poem’s call to accumulate virtue through good deeds echoes traditional practices of merit‑making and mindfulness. By engaging in charitable acts, sincere prayer, or meditative silence, one can fortify spiritual resilience. The anticipated clarity at the dragon‑snake meeting serves as a reminder that inner peace will ultimately prevail when past obstacles are addressed.",
