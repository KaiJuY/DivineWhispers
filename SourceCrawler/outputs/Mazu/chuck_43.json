    "en": "This poem's theme is impatience of the heart and the waiting for the right moment. The poem begins with \"A year of work flies like a bird\" which points out the author's hurried actions during the year, a lack of balance in mind. The second line advises \"You should keep calm and do not hesitate\" to let one put aside tension and remain serene so that things can progress orderly. The third line \"A benefactor is still a thousand miles away\" implies that although help is available, the benefactor is far, and patience is required. The last line \"News will gradually arrive at the middle of the month\" clearly indicates that after the lunar mid‑month (about the fifteenth day) news or a good omen will come. Overall, the poem uses four concise lines to describe the negative of impatience, the necessity of calm, and the importance of time and connections, reminding the reader not to lose the chance of observation and waiting because of haste. The verse, though brief, carries a universal message suitable for anyone seeking better timing in their pursuits.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは心の焦りと適切な時を待つことです。詩は「一年作事急如飛」で、作者が今年の行動を急ぎすぎていることを示し、心のバランスが欠けていることを指摘します。第二句の『君爾寬心莫遲疑』は、緊張を手放し、静かな心を保つように勧め、事が順調に進むようにします。第三句の『貴人還在千里外』は、助けがあるものの、貴人は遠く、忍耐が必要だと示唆します。最後の句『音信月中漸漸知』は、農暦の十五日前後の月中であれば、やがて知らせや好兆しが届くことを明確に示しています。全体として、四句で焦りの否定、静寂の必要性、時間と人脈の重要性を描き、急ぎすぎて観察と待機の機会を失わないよう読者に促しています。詩は簡潔ながらも普遍的なメッセージを持ち、タイミングを見極めようとする読者に適しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the speaker’s current impatience and haste hinder progress, and that calm patience, along with the right timing and external help, are essential for favorable outcomes. The poem emphasizes the importance of internal composure, external support, and the passage of time, suggesting that results will arrive after the lunar midpoint, a symbolic period of transition.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem’s urging to “keep calm and do not hesitate” can be interpreted as a reminder to manage stress. By avoiding hurried decisions and allowing oneself to breathe, one reduces the risk of acute anxiety or burnout. Over time, a steadier approach contributes to better physical resilience.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The mention of a benefactor “still a thousand miles away” hints at external support in matters of affection. Patience in relationships, rather than impulsive action, fosters deeper trust. When the time of the lunar midpoint arrives, mutual understanding is likely to blossom.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The first line’s “a year of work flies like a bird” warns against rushed efforts in the workplace. A measured pace and readiness to wait for the right opportunity can lead to sustainable career growth. The poem implies that success may come after the mid‑month, when momentum builds.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Impatience often leads to poor financial decisions. The poem’s counsel to remain calm serves as an advisory to consider investments carefully and not to chase quick gains. The eventual “news” after the lunar midpoint may indicate timely financial information.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   In the family context, the poem advises against hasty judgments. By taking time, family members can resolve conflicts peacefully. The gradual arrival of news symbolizes harmony being restored over time.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   External help (“benefactor”) and timely communication are crucial in maintaining a good reputation. Patience and measured interactions prevent misunderstandings. When the lunar midpoint passes, positive word‑of‑mouth or professional recognition is likely to emerge.",
