    "jp": "開花のあとに実がなる。富貴栄華と伴って老いまで出来るでしょう。君子と小人が出会えば、君子は思いやって、寛容するべき。お互いに仲良く付き合わせる。物事も順調に発展出来るが、煩悩をやめましょう。この籤は、この事の結果がすでに現れた。その結果は貴方と共に老いまで至るでしょう。悩まずに喜んで受けなさい。籤文章に「君子小人相会合」と言うのは、孔子が小児に出会いの物語からの意味で、理不尽、こじつける人に出会ったら、寛容して仲良く付き合わせましょう。「小人」も子供を指す意味があり、女性がこの籤を得た場合、妊娠、子を得る兆しもあるでしょう。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that after diligent cultivation, fruits are finally borne; wealth and honor accompany a lifetime, and harmonious coexistence with all people—whether virtuous or flawed—ensures a smooth, worry‑free existence. The verses weave a philosophy of patience, humility, and tolerance, encouraging readers to cherish long‑term stability and to approach interpersonal encounters with an open heart.\n\n1. Health\n   The line \"花開今已結成果\" metaphorically suggests that consistent effort, like nurturing a flower, eventually yields tangible results—an allegory for maintaining physical health through steady, disciplined habits. The calm tone of the final couplet \"萬事清吉莫煩惱\" implies that peace of mind reduces stress, which is a known contributor to overall wellness. Thus, the poem encourages a balanced lifestyle that nurtures both body and mind.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The instruction \"君子小人相會合\" calls for mutual understanding between people of different character. By fostering empathy and acceptance, partners can avoid conflict and build lasting bonds. The poem implies that loving relationships thrive when each person respects the other’s individuality, leading to harmony.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The image of \"富貴榮華終到老\" promises that sustained effort will bring prosperity that endures. It reminds professionals that true success is a long‑term journey, not quick wins. The poem advises setting realistic goals, persisting through setbacks, and maintaining modesty when achievements are attained.\n\n4. Finances\n   The second line assures that wealth and honor will persist into old age, symbolizing long‑term financial stability. It encourages prudent saving and ethical conduct, which are foundations for lasting financial security. The verses thus promote responsible money management and the avoidance of short‑sighted financial decisions.\n\n5. Spirituality\n   The final couplet \"萬事清吉莫煩惱\" encourages a mindset of \"go with the flow, at ease and worry‑free,\" aligning with the spiritual principle of surrendering to nature. This tranquility of mind is linked to spiritual fulfillment, as the poem suggests that inner peace is the key to a serene life. Readers are invited to let go of anxieties, thereby fostering deeper spiritual growth.\n\n6. Community and Social Life\n   The overall message stresses harmonious coexistence with all people, whether virtuous or flawed. By practicing tolerance and humility, individuals contribute to a stable, supportive society. The poem thus serves as a guide to face all matters with a peaceful heart in daily interactions.",
