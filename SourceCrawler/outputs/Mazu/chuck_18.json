    "en": "This poem's theme is a reflection on the importance of seeking guidance and support from benefactors during pivotal moments, emphasizing that with their assistance, one's future becomes bright and auspicious. The poem employs the term 'Lu Ma' (祿馬), which symbolizes both a fortunate horse and the auspicious progress of one's career or studies; historically, it also represents the horse ridden by an ancient scholar who attained the highest honors, implying academic success or official advancement. The fourth line, '和合自有兩分明,' indicates that under the help of a benefactor, affairs will tend toward harmony, and the outcomes will manifest in two distinct ways, urging the seeker to maintain inner balance and avoid bias. Overall, the poem serves as a reminder for the prudent individual to seek the aid of benevolent people when facing critical decisions, approaching future changes with a calm and balanced mindset.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、重要な局面で恩人や支援者の助けを求めることの重要性を示し、彼らの援助により未来が明るく吉祥になるというものです。詩中の『祿馬』という語は、幸運な馬を象徴すると同時に、事業や学業の順調な進展を意味し、古代の進士が最高の功績を収めた際に乗った馬を表すため、学術的成功や官職への昇進を暗示しています。第四行『和合自有兩分明』は、恩人の助力により事柄が調和し、結果が二つの明確な形で現れることを示し、内面的なバランスを保ち偏見を避けるよう促しています。総じて、この詩は、重要な決断を下す際に慈愛ある人々の援助を求め、未来の変化に対して落ち着きとバランスを保って臨むことを思い起こさせるメッセージです。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that when confronted with a critical juncture, the seeker should actively seek the support of a benefactor, as this will illuminate their path and lead to harmonious outcomes. The poem employs the motif of 'Lu Ma,' a symbol of fortune and advancement, indicating that success can be achieved through both personal effort and external aid. The concluding line emphasizes that harmony will naturally arise and that results will present in two distinct, clear forms, urging the individual to maintain balance and clarity.\n\n1. Health – The verse suggests that with the backing of a benefactor, one’s well‑being will improve, as the \"Lu Ma\" imagery implies vitality and smooth progress. A supportive relationship can help alleviate stress, encouraging a healthier lifestyle and better recovery when illness arises. Maintaining a harmonious state, as mentioned, further supports overall physical resilience.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – The poem encourages seeking guidance and assistance, hinting that healthy partnerships thrive on mutual support. By engaging kindly with others, one can achieve clarity in personal relationships, leading to balanced and respectful bonds. The dual outcomes in harmony remind partners to navigate differences calmly, strengthening their connection.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – The central metaphor of 'Lu Ma' explicitly alludes to career advancement and scholarly achievement. The promise of a benefactor’s help suggests that networking, mentorship, and guidance are key to professional growth. Recognizing that outcomes will split into two clear paths indicates the need to make deliberate choices among potential opportunities.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – A benevolent figure can open doors to financial success, as implied by the auspicious tone of the poem. The notion that future prospects are bright underscores the potential for profitable ventures when supported by wise counsel. Maintaining balance ensures prudent spending and steady investment decisions.\n\n5. Personal Growth – Harmony and clarity are recurring motifs, signifying that the seeker’s inner equilibrium will foster continuous self‑improvement. By embracing external support, one can develop resilience, adaptability, and a broader perspective on life’s challenges. The dual outcomes highlight the importance of reflective decision‑making in personal evolution.\n\n6. Spiritual Outlook – The poem’s symbolic language invites a metaphysical appreciation of fortune as a collaboration between effort and divine or benevolent guidance. The emphasis on harmony and distinct results encourages a calm, balanced mindset, facilitating a deeper connection to one's inner purpose and to the world at large.",
