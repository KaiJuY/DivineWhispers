    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對遠大志向與現實困境的對照。詩中以「欲去長江水闊茫」描繪心中渴望闖入廣闊天地，卻被「前途未遂運未通」揭示當下未能踏上之路。接續的「如今絲綿常在手」則象徵擁有機會、資源與才華，然而「只恐魚水不相逢」卻警示此時此刻尚未有合適的環境或時機，使得所有努力難以實現。整體而言，詩人表達了雖有才能與企圖，卻須先等待天時地利，才能將志向轉化為具體成果。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the contrast between lofty aspirations and present difficulties. The verse opens with “I long to go to the wide Yangtze River,” depicting a yearning to enter a vast realm, yet the following lines “my future has not succeeded and luck has not arrived” reveal that the path cannot yet be taken. The next line, “I always hold fishing thread in hand,” symbolizes having opportunities, resources, and talent, but the last line, “only fearing that fish and water will not meet,” warns that currently there is no suitable environment or timing, making all efforts hard to detal. Overall, the poet expresses that even with talent and ambition, one must first wait for the right circumstances to transform aspirations into tangible achievements.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、雄大な志望と現実の困難の対比です。詩は「長江の広い水を望む」と始まり、広大な世界へ踏み出したいという願望を描きますが、続く「未来は実現せず、運は来ない」と示し、まだ道を歩めない状況を明らかにします。次の行「いつも釣り糸を手に持つ」は、機会、資源、才能を持っていることを象徴しますが、最後の「魚と水が合わないだけを恐れる」は、現在は適切な環境やタイミングがないため、すべての努力が実を結びにくいことを警告します。全体として、詩人は才能と野心があっても、まずは適切な時期を待ち、志を具体的な成果へと変える必要があると表現しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that ambition and talent often await the right combination of time and environment before they can be fully realized. The poem uses the vivid image of longing to reach the expansive Yangtze River, juxtaposed with the reality that the path is blocked by an unfulfilled future and absent luck. The metaphor of fishing thread in hand represents the poet’s possession of opportunities, resources, and skill; yet the final line—“only fearing that fish and water will not meet”—underscores a lack of suitable conditions or timing, rendering all efforts difficult to translate into tangible outcomes.\n\n- **Health**: The yearning to enter a wide, powerful river symbolizes a desire for personal growth and resilience. In the short term, the poet recognizes that while their skills and determination are present, the current environment is not conducive to healing or sustained health. Patience is advised, waiting for the right moment when internal and external conditions align to support well‑being.\n\n- **Finance**: The fishing thread represents financial resources or skill sets that could generate income, yet the fear that fish and water will not meet reflects a mismatch between available opportunities and the timing of market or economic cycles. The poem suggests that financial success may require external factors—such as market demand or favorable timing—to be present before investments or skills can yield results. Prudence and strategic waiting can help secure a stronger financial footing.\n\n- **Relationships**: Longing to reach the Yangtze parallels a desire for deeper, more expansive connections. The uncertainty in the poet’s future and luck illustrates a current lack of trust or shared understanding in personal relationships. The fear that fish and water do not meet may represent the disconnect between intentions and reality; thus, cultivating open communication and aligning expectations can create a more conducive environment for meaningful bonds.\n\n- **Career**: Ambition is clearly voiced in the line “I long to go to the wide Yangtze River,” yet the subsequent line of unfulfilled future indicates a stalled career path. Holding fishing thread symbolizes possessing qualifications, talent, or networking abilities, yet the fear of fish and water not meeting warns that projects or promotions may be delayed due to external constraints or misaligned timing. Career advancement therefore requires patience, aligning personal goals with organizational opportunities.\n\n- **Education**: The yearning to enter a vast realm is akin to a pursuit of higher learning or intellectual expansion. The poet’s acknowledgment of a failing future and absent luck indicates that current educational prospects may be limited by lack of funding, institutional support, or curriculum fit. The metaphor of fishing thread suggests readiness to study, but the final line cautions that a suitable academic environment is still pending. Strategic planning and seeking scholarships or mentorship can help bridge this gap.\n\n- **Personal Growth**: The overarching theme invites introspection on the balance between aspiration and circumstance. While talent and determination are present, the poem cautions that personal development cannot flourish without the right context and timing. By recognizing this, one can cultivate patience, seek constructive environments, and ultimately transform ambition into lasting personal achievements.",
