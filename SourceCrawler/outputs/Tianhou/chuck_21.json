    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於人生運勢的變化與未來的期盼。詩句中提到「汝今行運未全通」，顯示目前的運氣尚未完全順利，仍需等待春季的到來以求得萬象融和。隨著春風來臨，疾病漸漸痊癒，元氣得以恢復，從而自然地達成心中所想。詩中強調的是順應時節、堅持健康與心態的調整，並以春天作為重新啟動與實現願望的象徵。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the changes in one's life fortunes and the anticipation for the future. The verse mentions \"you now are not entirely fortunate,\" indicating that current luck is not entirely smooth, and one must wait for the arrival of spring to achieve harmony among all things. As spring arrives, illness gradually heals, vitality is restored, and naturally one achieves what one desires. The poem emphasizes following the season, maintaining health and mental adjustment, and using spring as a symbol of restarting and realizing one's wishes.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは人生の運勢の変化と将来への期待についてです。詩中に「汝今行運未全通」とあるように、現在の運が完全に順調ではなく、春の到来を待って万象が融和することを求めるべきであることを示しています。春が訪れれば、病気は徐々に治り、元気が回復し、自然と心の望みを成し遂げることができるという意味です。詩は季節に従い、健康と心の調整を堅持し、春を再出発と願いを実現する象徴として用いることを強調しています。",
