    "zh": "這首詩的主題是以蛟龍為象徵，描繪突如其來的驚變與內在心態的變化。詩句開頭以「忽見蛟龍起海中」揭示世事變幻，隨後「雲騰致雨浪滔天」強調局勢風起雲湧。對善人而言，雖遭遇巨變，仍能心安定；相對於庸俗之人，則會膽戰心忡，顯示性格與境遇的互動。整體詩意提示：人心與外在情勢相輔相成，保持坦然方能抵禦風浪，亦提醒人需警惕不被外物所擾。詩中亦暗示，面對突發情境，心態穩定者可轉危為機，反之則易被動傷害，故修身養性尤為關鍵。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the use of a mythical dragon as a symbol, depicting sudden change and the inner shift of mind. The poem opens with \"Suddenly I see a dragon rise in the sea,\" revealing the ever-changing world, followed by \"The clouds rise, bringing rain and roaring waves,\" emphasizing turbulent circumstances. For the virtuous, though facing great change, they remain calm; in contrast, the ordinary are filled with fear and anxiety, showing the interaction between character and circumstance. The overall meaning suggests that the mind and external situation support each other, maintaining composure allows one to withstand the waves, and reminds us to be cautious of external disturbances. The poem also hints that facing sudden situations, those with steady hearts can turn danger into opportunity, while those who are passive are easily harmed, so cultivating oneself is key.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、神話の龍を象徴として用い、突如として起こる変化と内面の心の変容を描くことです。詩は『忽然と海中に龍が現れた』という行から始まり、世界の変わりゆく様を示し、続いて『雲が上がり、雨と荒波をもたらす』と、荒れ狂う状況を強調します。善人は大きな変化に直面しても平穏を保ちますが、庶民は恐怖と不安で満ち、性格と状況の相互作用を示します。全体として、心と外部の状況が互いに補完し、落ち着きを保つことで波を乗り越え、外的な干渉を警戒することを示唆します。詩はまた、突発的な状況に直面した際、安定した心を持つ者は危機を機会に変え、受動的な者は傷つきやすく、自己を磨くことが重要であると示唆しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that sudden upheaval—symbolized by a dragon rising from the sea—serves as a catalyst for testing the inner composure of individuals. The poem contrasts the responses of the virtuous, who maintain a calm heart, with those of the ordinary, who experience fear and anxiety. It underscores the symbiotic relationship between a person’s mindset and external circumstances, illustrating that calmness and self‑control are essential to weather metaphorical storms. The poem further implies that those who can keep a steady mind can transform danger into opportunity, whereas those who are reactive are more likely to suffer harm, highlighting the importance of cultivating inner strength and emotional resilience.\n\n1. Health\n   The imagery of waves and rain symbolizes health challenges. The virtuous calmness suggests that maintaining mental serenity can help prevent illness. Conversely, anxiety and fear—displayed by the ordinary—may lead to stress‑related health problems.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The poem warns that during turbulent times, partners who stay composed are more likely to support each other. In contrast, those overwhelmed by fear may create tension, indicating the need for mutual calm and understanding.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Sudden changes are likened to career disruptions. A steady mind, as shown by the virtuous, can navigate obstacles successfully. Fearful reactions may hinder progress and lead to missed opportunities.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   The metaphor of rising waters implies financial volatility. Calm decision‑making can protect assets, while anxiety may cause impulsive spending or poor investment choices.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Family dynamics may mirror the poem’s storm. Those who remain centered can preserve harmony, whereas those who panic risk conflict. The poem encourages emotional stability to foster a peaceful home environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Public perception during crises depends on personal composure. A calmidr persona can maintain a positive reputation, while fear can damage social standing. The poem advises maintaining inner poise to uphold credibility and trust within the community.",
