  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that true prosperity arises from a harmonious blend of material abundance, moral virtue, and inner tranquility. The lines portray a home that thrives because of the nurturing presence of virtue, a life sustained by righteousness and benevolence, a stability that resembles an immovable mountain, and a daily accumulation of blessings that signals ongoing good fortune. The verses emphasize that without a solid moral foundation, external wealth can be unstable; only when heart, mind, and environment are balanced can one achieve lasting success and peace.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem suggests that virtue nourishes the body, implying that moral integrity and ethical living support physical well‑being. A steady, virtuous lifestyle can ward off illness and promote vitality.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – By stressing righteousness and benevolence, the verses point to harmony in personal bonds. Compassionate conduct fosters deeper, more stable connections, and shared moral values strengthen partnership.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The reference to a prosperous home and the comparison to an unmovable mountain imply career stability rooted in integrity. Ambition is encouraged, but only when aligned with ethical principles will it lead to genuine accomplishment.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Material gain is portrayed as a natural consequence of virtue. Financial success is not portrayed as a goal alone but as a byproduct of a principled, well‑balanced life.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The poem emphasizes familial stability, likening it to a mountain that cannot be displaced. A home that practices virtue will nurture unity, reduce conflict, and foster collective growth.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Public perception and reputation are tied to the moral character depicted in the verses. A person who acts with righteousness will attract respect, build trustworthy networks, and secure a favorable standing within the community.",
