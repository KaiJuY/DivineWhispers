    "zh": "這首詩的主題是說千倉米粟如山，象徵積累與實力。詩中以山高谷深的景象暗示努力的長遠與艱辛；米粟的堆積象徵經濟與實力的累積，提示財富需經由勤奮與分惠來維持。分惠饑貧不難的觀點提醒人們應以善意與公平對待弱者，從而獲得社會的認同與支持。勸人勤勉培養善果，說盛衰興廢循環本循，告訴我們人生與事業皆由不斷的付出與善行形成，成功與失敗在於持續的努力與正直。詩中還透露，堆積的米粟若不善加利用，最終仍可能被浪費，提醒人們應把握機會，合理規劃，將積累的資源轉化為持久的價值。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is that a thousand heaps of rice and millet stacked like a mountain symbolize accumulation and strength. The poem uses the image of high mountains and deep valleys to suggest long-term and arduous effort; the heap of rice and millet symbolizes economic and practical accumulation, hinting that wealth must be maintained through diligence and sharing. The view that sharing to relieve poverty is not difficult reminds people to treat the weak with kindness and fairness, thus gaining social recognition and support. It encourages diligence and cultivation of good deeds, saying that the cycle of rise and fall is inherent, telling us that life and career are formed by continuous contribution and good actions, success and failure lie in sustained effort and integrity. The poem also reveals that if the accumulated rice and millet is not wisely used, it may ultimately be wasted, reminding people to seize opportunities, plan rationally, and convert accumulated resources into lasting value.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、千の米と粟の山のように積み重ねられたものが蓄積と力を象徴するということです。詩は高い山と深い谷というイメージを使い、長期的で困難な努力を示唆しています。米と粟の堆積は経済的・実務的な蓄積を象徴し、富は勤勉と共有によって維持されるべきだと示唆しています。貧困を軽減するために分かち合うことが難しくないという見解は、人々に弱者を親切と iṣẹ公平に扱うよう促し、社会的認識と支持を得るように導きます。勤勉と善行の育成を勧め、盛衰の循環が本質であると語り、人生とキャリアは継続的な貢献と善行によって形作られ、成功と失敗は持続的な努力と正直さにあると告げています。さらに、積み重ねた米と粟を賢く使わないと最終的に浪費される可能性があると示し、機会をつかみ、合理的に計画し、蓄積した資源を永続的な価値に変えるよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the tangible abundance—represented by heaps of rice and millet—serves as a metaphor for the accumulation of resources, virtues, and life’s enduring strength. The mountain imagery reminds us that such wealth, while powerful, is not static; it demands continuous, often arduous effort and responsible sharing to be truly effective. The poem further cautions that neglect or mismanagement can lead to waste, urging careful planning and conversion of resources into lasting value. This holistic view encourages readers to view material and moral accumulation as interlinked, guiding them toward sustainable, purposeful living.\n\n**1. Personal Development**\nThe poem stresses that diligence and cultivation of good deeds are central to personal growth. By encouraging steady effort and integrity, it teaches that lasting success is rooted in consistent, honest work. Ignoring this principle risks stagnation and loss of personal agency.\n\n**2. Financial Management**\nRice and millet stacked like a mountain illustrate that wealth is a result of accumulated effort and sharing. Financial prosperity is portrayed as dependent on hard work and equitable distribution rather than mere accumulation. Proper stewardship, therefore, is essential to prevent eventual waste.\n\n**3. Community Service**\nThe idea that relief to the poor is not difficult serves as a call to treat the vulnerable with kindness and fairness. Such generosity not only alleviates hardship but also garners societal respect and support. Community bonds are strengthened when resources are shared responsibly.\n\n**4. Moral Responsibility**\nGood deeds and their cultivation are highlighted as foundations for a thriving career and life. Success hinges on continual contribution and ethical conduct, while failure stems from lack of sustained effort. Moral responsibility is thus portrayed as the cornerstone of enduring achievement.\n\n**5. Opportunity Utilization**\nThe poem warns that amassed resources, if not used wisely, may ultimately be wasted. It urges individuals to seize timely opportunities and plan strategically. Turning accumulated resources into lasting value becomes a key measure of wise stewardship.\n\n**6. Long‑Term Value Creation**\nBeyond immediate benefits, the poem suggests transforming material accumulation into enduring worth. It advocates for rational planning and sustainable use of resources. Such long‑term value creation secures lasting benefits for both the individual and the broader community.",
