    "en": "This poem's theme is: using the quiet virtue of benevolent deeds (yin‑deer) to avert the dangers on the path ahead. The author, speaking to a child, points out that the road ahead is rough and uneven, and a troubled person will need saving; however, only by relying on hidden acts of kindness and sincere inner strength can one avoid disaster, stay safe, and proceed smoothly. The verse emphasizes that external hardships and challenges are not necessarily insurmountable, and if one maintains the virtue of yin‑deer, one can see light in adversity. The poem encourages people to not abandon inner cultivation and benevolence when facing the unknown and difficulties, using it as the fundamental means to overcome hardships and secure the future. Yin‑deer is not only a concrete act of doing good, but also an embodiment of hidden cultivation and inner peace. By conversing with the child, the poet reminds us that even when facing unforeseeable risks and challenges, as long as one steadfastly holds the virtue of yin‑deer, one can find protection in the shadows.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは：静かなる善行の陰隸徳（イング）を使って、先に立つ道の危険を回避することです。作者は子に話し、道が険しく不平で、困った人が救われる必要があると指摘しますが、隠れた善行と誠実な内なる力に頼ることでのみ災いを避け、安全で順調に進むことができます。詩は外部の困難や挑戦は必ずしも乗り越えられないものではなく、陰隸の徳を守れば逆境の中で光を見出せると強調しています。詩は、人々に未知と困難に直面したとき、内面の修養と善念を放棄せず、これを克服と未来の確保の根本手段とするよう促しています。陰隸は善行の具体的な行為だけでなく、隠れた修養と内面の平安の体現でもあります。子と対話することで、詩人は、予測できないリスクや挑戦に直面しても、陰隸の徳を堅持すれば、闇の中で安全の庇護を見出せると知らせています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the quiet, hidden virtue of benevolent acts (陰隲) serves as a shield against the inevitable hardships and uncertainties that lie ahead. It encourages cultivating inner kindness and perseverance as a means to navigate obstacles, save those in distress, and maintain safety amid unpredictable dangers. The verses illustrate that while the path may be rugged and fraught, a steadfast commitment to invisible moral deeds can transform adversity into opportunity.\n\n1. Health: The poem advises that a strong inner moral compass—represented by the hidden virtue—can act as a preventive measure against physical and psychological harm. By cultivating quiet benevolence, individuals may experience better resilience, stress reduction, and overall well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: It underscores the importance of quietly supporting loved ones. When one offers unseen acts of kindness, bonds are strengthened, and those in need can be saved, reinforcing mutual trust and empathy.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Success in professional life is portrayed as linked gluten to silent integrity. Those who consistently engage in discreet positive work ethics may avoid setbacks, navigate competitive terrains, and achieve steady progress.\n\n4. Spiritual Growth: The central motif of陰隲 is a direct invitation to deep inner growth. Regular practice of silent benevolence fosters spiritual maturity, inner peace, and a sense of purpose.\n\n5. Community Service: The poem positions invisible acts of charity as essential to communal welfare. By quietly saving someone in distress, one contributes to a safer, more supportive environment for all.\n\n6. Personal Safety: The final message frames陰隲 as a literal protective force against catastrophe. Maintaining such virtue provides a metaphorical shield that keeps one from disaster and ensures continuity even when external circumstances threaten to derail one’s path.",
