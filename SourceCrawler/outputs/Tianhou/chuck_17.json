    "en": "This poem's theme is to emphasize that with a single heart and focused intention, one can achieve both fame and profit. The first lines, 'Seek fame, and from now on the road will be smooth; seek profit, and it will come from a fortuitous zone,' suggest that by pursuing a righteous path, one can obtain honor and wealth. The poem then warns against holding two thoughts simultaneously, for a divided mind will lead to misfortune.

In everyday life, this reminder advises that when pursuing career development or personal ideals, all energy should be directed toward one clear direction.

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that focused determination towards a single objective yields both recognition and material benefit, while a divided mind invites misfortune. The verses first affirm that pursuing fame and profit on a righteous path will bring smooth progress, and then caution against harboring two intentions simultaneously. They thus advocate disciplined concentration and the elimination of distractions, suggesting that success arises from sustained perseverance and decisive action. In daily life, this guidance translates into prioritizing one clear goal, whether in career, personal ambition, or relationships, to avoid scattered effort and to achieve tangible outcomes.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem’s emphasis on single-minded focus indirectly supports health by encouraging the practitioner to devote energy to one healthy habit or routine. A scattered mind may lead to inconsistent lifestyle choices that undermine wellbeing. By concentrating on a single health goal—such as regular exercise or balanced nutrition—one fosters steady improvement and reduces the risk of illness.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The text’s warning against dual intentions resonates in interpersonal contexts; a partner who seeks affection and material gain simultaneously may create conflict. The poem advises dedicating a unified intention to building affection or trust. Such focused effort strengthens bonds and yields deeper, more sustainable emotional fulfillment.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Explicitly, the poem extols the rewards of pursuing fame and profit through a righteous path. In career terms, this translates to setting a singular, clear professional goal—like mastering a skill or attaining a leadership role—and eliminating distractions. Persistence and decisiveness, as highlighted, are essential for career advancement and personal fulfillment.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   By linking fame and profit to a smooth journey, the verses imply that concentrated financial ambition can attract favorable circumstances. Concentrating on one financial objective—be it saving, investing, or earning—prevents misdirected spending. Consistent, disciplined action leads to tangible wealth accumulation.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   The poem’s counsel to avoid divided attention can be applied to familial relationships. Focusing on a single objective—such as nurturing a supportive environment—helps prevent conflict and fosters harmony. A unified family vision, supported by steady, decisive effort, sustains long‑term cohesion.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Finally, the poem suggests that a single-minded pursuit enhances reputation. By channeling efforts toward a single, positive image—such as integrity, professionalism, or community service—one builds a trustworthy persona. A focused reputation attracts allies and opens doors, reinforcing social standing.",
