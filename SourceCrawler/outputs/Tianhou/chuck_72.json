    "en": "This poem's theme is about an individual facing dual hardships of poverty and illness, reminding that both undermine one's mental and physical well‑being. The first line explains that poverty and disease simultaneously inflict great damage on the spirit, indicating a need for caution in both economic and health matters. The second line points out that losing an official position is not a sin, emphasizing resilience and self‑reflection at the personal level. The third line, “There is nothing more to be gained from this divination,” conveys that the current lot already offers no further change, indicating that one cannot seek improvement through this poem. The final line, “Close the door and guard quietly through autumn and spring,” advises maintaining calm and restraint, focusing on self‑cultivation and maintenance while awaiting seasonal change. Overall, the poem uses a calm, introspective tone to encourage people to remain steadfast in adversity, avoid excessive external pursuit, and take tranquility as the primary course of action.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、貧困と病気という二重の困難に直面している個人についてであり、精神と身体が削られることを警告しています。第一行は、貧困と病気が同時に精神に甚大な損傷を与えることを説明し、経済と健康の両面で慎重にする必要性を示しています。第二行は、官職を失うことが罪ではないと指摘し、個人レベルでの忍耐と自己省察を強調しています。第三行の「この籤で得られるものはもうない」は、現行の籤がこれ以上変化を与えないことを伝え、詩文を通じて運命を変えることができないことを示しています。最後の行の「閉門静守度秋春」は、静かに閉ざし、内面を整えながら自我を養い、季節の変わり目を待つよう勧めています。全体として、この詩は静寂で内省的な語調で逆境に耐えるよう励まし、過度な外的追求を避け、静寂を主要な行動方針とするよう促しています.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that a person experiencing simultaneous hardship from poverty and disease should not seek external solutions; instead, maintaining inner calm and focusing on self‑care is the advised course. The poem explicitly states that losing an official post is not a fault, highlighting that personal resilience is五星 rather than reliance on status. It emphasizes the futility of further gain from the current divination, warning that the lot itself provides no additional change. Finally, it advises closing the door and guarding quietly through the seasons, symbolizing a retreat from the noise of the world and an emphasis on inner cultivation. \n\n**Health**: The poet urges careful attention to both economic and physical well‑being, suggesting that individuals in such circumstances must adopt preventive habits, monitor their diet, and seek basic medical care within their means. The poem's tone warns of significant spiritual damage, implying that neglecting health can compound suffering.\n\n**Finance**: The poem suggests prudence in spending and managing limited resources. A cautious approach to finances helps prevent worsening the poverty that feeds into the mental strain described.\n\n**Career**: It stresses that a loss of official position is not a sin, meaning career setbacks should be viewed as a part of life's flow, not as moral failing. Acceptance of such loss encourages a focus on internal growth rather than chasing external titles.\n\n**Personal Development**: The poem's instruction to guard quietly through the seasons implies that disciplined personal development—meditation, reflection, and gradual self‑improvement—is a reliable method to endure adversity. Maintaining discipline is presented as the primary tool.\n\n**Emotional Well‑Being**: The line about staying silent and closed signals that emotional turbulence should be mitigated by withdrawal from external stimuli. Emotional resilience is fostered by cultivating calm and composure, which is essential in the face of hardship.\n\n**Spiritual Guidance**: By recommending that one should not seek further gain from the divination, the poem encourages reliance on inner spirituality and trust in the natural rhythm of life. The final guidance to wait for the seasonal transition reflects a spiritual acceptance of time and patience.\n\nIn summary, the poem offers a holistic approach: manage finances and health carefully, accept career shifts without shame, invest in self‑care and inner tranquility, and trust that patience and calmness can sustain one through the trials of poverty and disease.",
