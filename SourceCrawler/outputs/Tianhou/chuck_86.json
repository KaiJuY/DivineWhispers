    "zh": "這首詩的主題是描述人生在運勢波折中的挑戰與應對。詩中用江河與船隻喚起順境與逆境的變幻；青龍與白虎則象徵吉凶交錯，暗示雖有危險但亦有機會。若遇青龍，則可化危為安；遇白虎則需警惕膽寒，積極防範。整體上提醒人們在面對風雨變幻時，需保持警覺與自信，並以適時之行動，將不測轉為機遇。詩中亦以龍虎之象，暗喻人心中善惡交織的內在衝突；青龍象徵順勢與積極，白虎則警示危險與恐懼。面對船翻覆，應如水面波濤般保持冷靜，將不利轉為動力。",
    "en": "The theme of this poem is the challenge and response in life's fluctuating fortunes. The poem uses rivers and ships to evoke the changing of favorable and unfavorable circumstances; The blue dragon and white tiger symbolize the interweaving of good and bad, suggesting that although danger exists, there are also opportunities. If one encounters ligger blue dragon, one can turn peril into safety; encountering the white tiger requires vigilance against fear and active prevention. Overall, it reminds people to remain alert and confident when facing changing winds and rains, and to act timely to transform uncertainties into opportunities. The poem also employs the dragon‑tiger motif to metaphorically represent the internal conflict of good and evil within the heart; The blue dragon signifies 顺势 (favorable momentum) and proactivity, while the white tiger warns of danger and terror. When faced with a ship overturning, one should remain calm like waves on the water, turning adversity into momentum.",
    "jp": "この詩の主題は、人生の運勢の波折の中での挑戦と対応についてです。 詩は江河と船を使って、順境と逆境の変化を呼び覚ます; 青龍と白虎は吉凶の交錯を象徴し、危険があっても機会もあることを示唆します。 青龍に遭遇したら危機を安全に変えることができ、白虎に遭遇したら恐怖を警戒し、積極的に防ぐ必要があります。 全体として、変わりゆく風雨に直面したときに警戒と自信を保ち、適時行動することで不測を機会に変えるよう人々に促します。 詩はまた龍虎の象徴を使って、人間の心の中の善悪の内部衝突を比喩しています; 青龍は順勢と積極を象徴し、白虎は危険と恐怖を警告します。 船が転覆する場合、水面の波のように冷静さを保ち、逆境を勢いに変えるべきです。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that life’s fortunes are as shifting as a river, and a seemingly safe vessel can suddenly overturn. The blue dragon and white tiger symbolize the coexistence of fortune and peril; the dragon offers transformation of danger into safety, while the tiger warns of fear and necessitates active prevention. The poem therefore calls for calmness, vigilance, and timely action to convert uncertainty into opportunity.\n\n1. **Health** – The imagery of a ship tossed by the river urges readers to monitor their well‑being closely. Physical stress or illness can appear abruptly, so regular check‑ups and mindful habits are essential. By staying calm, one can transform physical setbacks into stronger resilience.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The dual presence of the dragon and tiger highlights the ebb and flow of affection. When harmony is achieved, love can be nurtured with confidence; yet sudden disagreements may arise, demanding open communication and preventive care. A balanced partnership thrives when partners remain alert and proactive.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The poem likens professional journeys to navigating a river; what seems a steady ascent can swiftly reverse. Encountering the dragon indicates that setbacks can be reframed into career growth, whereas the tiger warns of complacency that could lead to loss. Success thus hinges on timely, decisive action and maintaining a proactive mindset.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Economic conditions are portrayed as the river’s changing currents. While financial risk exists, the poem suggests that careful planning can turn peril into prosperity. Wise investments and prudent budgeting are recommended to convert financial uncertainty into opportunity.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Internal conflict, as symbolized by the dragon‑tiger motif, mirrors familial tensions. When family dynamics shift, remaining calm and engaged can transform discord into unity. The poem encourages open dialogue and supportive actions to sustain harmonious relations.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The tiger’s warning of fear underscores the importance of protecting one’s reputation. By acting with vigilance and integrity, one can prevent social setbacks. Maintaining a calm presence in public interactions allows one to turn potential criticism into constructive growth.\n\nOverall, the poem emphasizes that adversity—whether in health, love, career, finances, family, or social life—can be turned into momentum through composure, vigilance, and timely, proactive measures.",
