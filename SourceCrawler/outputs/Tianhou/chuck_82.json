    "en": "This poem’s theme is the harmony between fortune and the natural world. The appearance of migratory geese at dawn symbolizes auspiciousness and smooth communication, suggesting ease and clarity of purpose. The phrase “Wu‑tou Yue‑wei good composure” advises maintaining calm confidence in one’s actions. The moon, round as a mirror, embodies a clear mind and careful observation; meeting a celestial being indicates that wishes will be carried away by the wind when one aligns with the heavens. Overall, the poem constructs its message through natural imagery, emphasizing conformity to the seasons and inner temperament to fulfill desires, and reminds the reader to adopt a tranquil posture when embracing opportunities. The poet employs the goose as a seasonal symbol, its northern flight representing distant messages and blessings; the moon signifies serenity and completeness, urging that while success comes, inner peace must be preserved. Though concise, the verses encapsulate a principle of following nature, seizing moments, and facing uncertainty with composure.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運勢と天地の調和です。詩では鴛鴦の来訪が吉祥運を象徴し、順調で通達を示します。吴頭越尾の「好から容」は行動を落ち着いて自信を持って行うべきと提案します。明月の円満像は心境の澄んだ観察を寓意し、神仙に出会うと風とともに願望が達成されます。全体として自然の象徴で構成され、順応天時と心性で願いを叶えることを強調し、静かな姿勢で機会を迎えるべきと促します。詩人は鴛鴦を季節の象徴として用い、北から飛来し遠方からのメッセージと祝福を象徴します。明月は静寂と円満を象徴し、順調な中でも内面の平和を保つべきと示唆します。詩全体は簡潔ながら順応自然・機会を捉える道を示し、人生で機会を掴み、未知に対して落ち着いた心で臨むことを提言します。",

By maintaining composure in daily life, one may avoid overexertion and cultivate a harmonious body‑mind connection.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The gentle guidance of “ 情” and the clear sight of the moon suggests nurturing intimacy through understanding and patience.

Engaging in mindful habits, such as reducing waste or conserving resources, reflects the harmony emphasized throughout the verses.",
