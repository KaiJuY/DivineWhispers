    "en": "This poem's theme is revealing the philosophy of human cunning and its self‑fulfilling consequences. The poem uses imagery of schemes becoming increasingly intricate and eyes like thunder to describe how people set traps to fulfill selfish desires, ultimately being punished by fate. It metaphorically says that 'one creates their own suffering', meaning that those who do evil will suffer themselves; those who do good will receive good rewards. The poem reminds people to beware of hidden desires, stay away from plots, and uphold integrity and kindness to avoid calamities. The language is concise yet profound, urging society to base itself on honesty and integrity, warning against deceptive scheming. Continuing with sly trickery will eventually bring punishment; conversely, a person with integrity will enjoy peace and stability. It also reminds individuals in interpersonal interactions to avoid being blinded by short‑term interests, to avoid falling into irreversible disputes.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人間の狡猾さとそれがもたらす自己実現的な結果を明らかにする哲学です。詩は、陰謀が日々巧妙になり、神の目が雷のように閃くというイメージを使い、人々が自己欲求を満たすために罠を設け、最終的に天命により罰せられる様子を描写します。『自作自受』という比喩は、悪を行えば自らが害を受け、善を行えば善い報いを得ることを示します。この詩は、人々に隠れた欲望に注意し、陰謀を避け、正直と善行を守ることで災難を避けるよう促しています。言葉は簡潔でありながら深遠で、社会が誠実と信頼を基盤にし、詐欺的な陰謀を警戒すべきだと訴えます。ずっと巧妙な策を続ければ、最終的に報いを受けることになり、対照的に正直な人は安泰を得るでしょう。また、人間関係を処理する際に短期的な利益に目をくらまされず、回復不可能な争いに陥らないように注意するよう促しています。",

Health: The poem's warning against deceit signals that ill intentions can lead to personal health decline. A mind consumed by malice or hidden schemes may experience stress, compromising immunity and overall well‑being. Maintaining honesty and calm thus supports a robust state of health. 2. Love and Relationships: In relationships, concealed agendas can create distrust and conflict. The poem advises transparency and integrity to nurture trust and harmony between partners. Avoiding manipulative tactics preserves emotional bonds and prevents relational turmoil. Technical: The poem stresses that a lack of mutual respect can erode affection, while sincere communication builds a foundation for lasting affection. 3. Career and Ambition: Professional success built on subterfuge is short‑lived, as the poem asserts that dishonest methods invite downfall. It encourages building a reputation rooted in competence and ethical conduct, which brings lasting advancement. Pursuing ambition through honest effort yields sustainable progress. 4. Financial and Economic Life: The poem highlights that financial gains derived from deception will ultimately attract loss or misfortune. It urges prudent stewardship, emphasizing that integrity in monetary dealings safeguards against future economic volatility. Transparent financial practices foster trust and reduce the risk of financial crises. 5. Spiritual and Moral Growth: The poem underscores the principle that moral integrity is essential for spiritual well‑being. Engaging in ethical practices cultivates a sense of inner peace and spiritual resilience, while dishonest actions lead to spiritual emptiness and discord. The verse teaches that aligning one's inner motives with ethical conduct promotes inner harmony. 6. Community and Public Image: The poem stresses that deceitful conduct tarnishes one's reputation, which in turn influences community standing. Honesty builds social capital, encouraging mutual respect and collective harmony. The verse warns that manipulation ultimately undermines trust and can lead to social isolation, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a principled public image.",
