    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於親情、疾病與修身之道。詩中提到「骨肉緣何有異心」指出親人之間因病痛而產生誤解與衝突，暗示身體與心靈的關係。接著「自因疾病苦相侵」說明疾病帶來的身體痛楚與精神煎熬，提醒人應正視自身健康。作者勸諫「改圖行孝弟」呼籲人們以孝敬父母、尊重兄弟為修身之本，藉由調整行為與心態，減輕疾病帶來的負擔。最後「挽回造化莫因循」警示不要固守舊有的命運觀，應以行動去改變運勢，才能真正恢復家庭和諧。整體而言，詩歌強調健康與親情的相互影響，並以修身養德為轉運之關鍵。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the interrelation between family bonds, illness, and personal cultivation. The line “bone and flesh, why do kin have discord?” points to misunderstandings that arise among relatives when sickness afflicts them, hinting at the link between physical health and emotional harmony. The next phrase, “because illness invades and brings suffering,” highlights the physical pain and mental distress that come with disease, urging people to confront their health seriously. The author then urges, “alter your course and practice filial piety and brotherly love,” calling for caring for parents and respecting siblings as the foundation of moral self‑discipline; by adjusting one’s conduct and mindset, one can alleviate the burdens caused by illness. Finally, “reclaim destiny and do not follow old patterns” warns against clinging to static fate, urging active steps to reshape fortune and truly restore familial harmony. Overall, the poem stresses the mutual influence of health and kinship, and uses moral cultivation as the key to turning one’s circumstances around.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、親情、病気、そして自己鍛錬の相互関係についてです。『骨肉緣何有異心』という句は、病が家族に生じると、親しい間柄に誤解や衝突が生まれることを示し、身体と心のつながりを暗示します。続く『自因疾病苦相侵』は、病気がもたらす肉体的苦痛と精神的煎りを指摘し、健康に真剣に向き合うべきだと促します。作者は『改図行孝弟』で、親を敬い兄弟を尊重することを修身の基盤とし、行動と心構えを変えることで病の負担を和らげるよう勧めます。最後の『挽回造化莫因循』は、運命を受け入れ続けるのではなく、行動で運勢を変えるべきだと警告し、家族の和を実際に取り戻す方法を示します。全体として、この詩は健康と親情の相互作用を強調し、徳の修養が運勢を切り替える鍵であると説いています。",

The poet urges a shift from passive acceptance to active cultivation of filial devotion and fraternal respect, positing moral integrity as a means to reshape one's fate. By recognizing disease as a catalyst for introspection, one can transform suffering into an impetus for personal betterment and communal solidarity.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem highlights how sickness can cause both bodily suffering and psychological distress, reminding readers to take proactive measures for well‑being. It stresses the importance of self‑care and early intervention, suggesting that a healthy body supports harmonious relationships.\n\n2.

By practicing filial piety and brotherly love, the poem advises repairing misunderstandings and fostering empathy, thereby strengthening bonds.\n\n3.
