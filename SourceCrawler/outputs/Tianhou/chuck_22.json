    "en": "The theme of this poem is the confrontation and helplessness between seeking fortune and disease. The poem states that \"Fortune has never been easy to obtain,\" implying that happiness is not easily achieved and requires effort. However, \"to exhaust one's heart and mind in futile schemes\" reveals that even wholehearted effort often ends in futility, leaving only \"in the end nothing but ridicule,\" emphasizing that despite all efforts, outcomes may not be as desired. Ultimately, \"illness invades, and all affairs cease,\" portrays the inevitable decline to sickness and failure, reminding that even if one pursues fortune, fate remains inescapable. The tone is grave, the words concise yet full of imagery, expressing a sense of powerlessness against destiny and warning that in the pursuit of material wealth and fame, one must not neglect physical health and inner balance.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、福を求めることと病との対立と無力感についてです。詩は『福は決して得やすいものではない』と述べ、幸福は容易に得られるものではなく、努力が必要だと示唆しています。しかし、『心と意志を尽くしても徒労』と示すことで、全力を尽くしても無駄になることが多いと指摘し、最終的に「結局は笑いに終わるだけである」と結末に至ります。最後に『病が侵入し、すべての事が終わる』と描き、人が福を追い求めても、運命は逃れられないと警告しています。詩の語調は厳かで、言葉は簡潔ながらも意匠が濃く、運命に対する無力感を表し、物質的な富や名声を追求する際に健康と内面的なバランスを忘れないよう警告しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the pursuit of fortune, no matter how earnest, is often futile and can leave one vulnerable to illness and misfortune; it cautions that true wellbeing lies not in relentless striving for external gain but in recognizing the limits of one's influence over fate.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem explicitly warns that relentless pursuit of success can compromise one's health. It suggests that neglecting bodily well‑being leads to disease that ultimately halts all endeavors. Maintaining a balanced lifestyle is essential to prevent illness from derailing ambitions.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   By highlighting the futility of effort, the verse implies that over‑investment in external achievements may strain personal bonds. It advises focusing on nurturing relationships rather than exhausting oneself for material success. Mutual support becomes a safeguard against the isolation that can accompany relentless ambition.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The stanza underscores that even exhaustive planning may not guarantee favorable outcomes. Ambition should therefore be tempered with humility and realistic expectations. Seeking meaningful progress rather than mere accolades protects against disappointment.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   The poem's warning about futile effort extends to financial pursuits; машины chasing wealth without prudence may yield nothing but waste. It recommends prudent budgeting and long‑term planning over speculative ventures. A cautious approach safeguards against sudden financial setbacks.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   The message cautions against allowing ambition to disrupt familial harmony. When one is consumed by external goals, family life may suffer, leading to discord. Prioritizing family obligations preserves emotional stability and prevents the \"laughter\" of failure at home.\n\n5. Social Connections and Reputation\n   The poem indicates that relentless striving can damage social standing if one neglects genuine interactions. Reputation may suffer if the pursuit of status eclipses authentic empathy. Cultivating sincere relationships builds resilience against public ridicule.",
