    "en": "This poem's theme is focusing on one's primary occupation, warning against extravagant desires and frequent career changes that cause turmoil and instability. By depicting the diligent woodworker with a spinning wheel, the poem emphasizes the importance of supporting the family and maintaining daily responsibilities. Excessive pursuit of a new profession can disrupt household harmony and cause mental unrest. The poem advocates building on solid work foundations, preserving family harmony and economic stability, and cautions against losing one's footing due to excessive ambition. It also suggests that while pursuing one's main job is essential, one must keep a balanced mindset to avoid neglecting long-term values for fleeting glamour. In a modern context where job-hopping and materialism prevail, this message serves as a reminder to return to basics and secure one's roots. Through its concise four lines, the poet uses imagery of labor and everyday life to remind readers not to let desire disturb their life, ensuring inner peace and family wellbeing.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、主な職業に専念し、贅沢な欲望や頻繁な転職がもたらす波乱や不安を警告することです。回転木工の勤勉さを描いた詩は、家族を養い、日常の責務を守る重要性を強調しています。新たな職業を過度に追求すると、家庭の調和が乱れ、精神的な不安を招く可能性があります。この詩は、確かな職業基盤を築き、家族の調和と経済的安定を保つことを提唱し、過度な野心で根を失わないよう注意を促しています。また、主要な仕事を続けることは重要だが、短期的な華やかさに目を奪われず長期的価値を見失わないようバランスの取れた心構えを保つべきだと示唆しています。現代の職業転換や物質主義が蔓延する中、このメッセージは基礎に戻り根を固めるよう促す警告です。簡潔な四行で、詩人は労働と日常のイメージを用い、欲望に生活を乱されず内面の平和と家族の福祉を確保するよう読者に呼びかけています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a reminder to stay committed to one's main occupation and avoid unnecessary ambitions or frequent job changes that can stir turmoil and instability. The poem uses the image of a diligent woodworker turning a wheel to symbolize steady labor and a solid foundation, while the caution against extravagant desires emphasizes the importance of maintaining daily responsibilities and safeguarding family harmony. In modern times, where career mobility and material aspirations are often prized, the poem offers a counterpoint, urging individuals to ground themselves in reliable work, preserve internal peace, and nurture long‑term values over fleeting glamour.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem underscores the link between a stable occupation and physical wellbeing. Constant job shifts or chasing ill‑suited careers can create stress, which may lead to illness. A steady routine provides a predictable schedule that supports rest and healthy habits.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – By advocating for reliable daily commitments, the verse highlights the role of consistency in building trust with partners. A steady income and predictable routine allow couples to focus on nurturing intimacy rather than wrestling with financial uncertainty.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The core lesson warns against chasing unsustainable aspirations. Instead, it calls for a measured, diligent approach to one’s current role, emphasizing that true career satisfaction arises from mastery and steady progress, not from rapid, risky changes.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Maintaining one’s primary job ensures a consistent cash flow, reducing the risk of sudden income gaps that could jeopardize savings and investments. The poem suggests that prudence and avoidance of excess lead to long‑term financialdv stability.\n\n5. **Family and Community** – A reliable occupation contributes to a family’s security and societal contribution. Steady work allows individuals to give back, support relatives, and participate in community life without fear of disruption.\n\n6. **Personal Growth** – The poem’s message of steady labor invites individuals to develop skills and values over time. Personal growth is thus framed as an accumulation of small, deliberate steps rather than a single, grand pivot that may bring short‑lived pride but long‑term loss of footing.",
