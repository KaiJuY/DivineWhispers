    "en": "This poem's theme is the warmth of spring and the joy of meeting a close friend. The poet begins with the phrase \"the east wind rushes in one night\", suggesting the spring breeze swiftly blows, causing flowers and plants to bloom in profusion, creating a brilliant scene; \"All flowers and plants compete to bloom\" further highlights the vibrant atmosphere of nature's contest for blooming, symbolizing the overflowing spring spirit in the human world. Next, the poet arrives at the \"golden platform\"—a symbol of abundance and honor—where he meets a close friend, and their friendship is as rich as wine; \"Sipping wine while watching flowers restores one's spirit\" depicts pouring a drink, admiring the floral scenery, with emotions and spirit being cleansed and revived. Overall, the poem expresses an appreciation for the beauty of nature, the sincerity of friendship, and the calmness of the soul, containing philosophical thoughts of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature and the elevation of emotions.",
