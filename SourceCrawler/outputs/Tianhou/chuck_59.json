    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對志向與命運的自省。詩中說「不為工賈不為農」，暗示作者不願從事商業或農耕，而是追求學問或文職；「黃卷青燈自苦攻」形容他長夜研讀、孤苦奮發，亦暗示其勤奮與自我懲戒。最後一句「若問終身休咎事、試看龍虎與風雲」則提醒讀者，若想知終身吉凶，不妨觀察天地間的龍、虎及風雲象徵，藉此洞悉自身運勢。整體來說，詩人以自我奮進為核心，認為命運不由他人決定，而是通過個人努力與對自然變化的洞察來把握。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is an introspection on ambition and destiny. It states that the speaker chooses neither merchant nor farmer, implying a pursuit of scholarship or civil service, and the phrase “yellow scroll, green lamp self‑suffering attack” depicts long‑night study and self‑discipline. The final line advises that to understand one’s lifelong fortunes, one should observe dragons, tigers and the wind and clouds as symbols of the changing world, thereby discerning personal fate. Overall, the poem emphasizes self‑driven effort and the understanding of natural change as the means to grasp destiny.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、志と運命に対する自己省察です。詩中では「工賈も農業もせず」という表現で、商売や農耕ではなく学問や文官を志す姿勢が示され、さらに「黄巻青灯自苦攻」は長夜にわたる勉学と自律を象徴します。最後の一節では、終身の吉凶を知るには龍・虎・風雲を観察し、自然の変化を洞察することで自身の運勢を見極めるべきだと提案しています。全体として、詩人は自己奮進と自然の変化への洞察こそ運命を握る鍵であると主張しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that destiny is shaped by personal effort and the keen observation of natural changes, rather than external occupations or predetermined paths. The speaker rejects the roles of merchant and farmer, choosing instead the solitary pursuit of learning, as symbolized by the yellow scroll and green lamp. The final admonition to look to dragons, tigers, and wind‑clouds for guidance underscores the belief that one’s fortunes can be discerned by interpreting the shifting forces of the world.\n\n1. **Health** – The relentless study implied by the “yellow scroll, green lamp” reflects mental endurance; readers may find that sustained focus can fortify both mind and body, yet should balance diligence with rest to avoid burnout.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The poem’s focus on self‑improvement suggests that cultivating inner virtues enhances interpersonal bonds; a person who masters self‑discipline is more likely to attract respectful and harmonious connections.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – By choosing a scholarly path over commerce or agriculture, the speaker values long‑term intellectual growth; similarly, professionals should pursue vocations aligned with their intrinsic interests, recognizing that true success comes from mastery rather than monetary gain.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – While the poem does not explicitly discuss material gain, the implication is that wealth will follow dedication; prudent financial stewardship is advised, but should never eclipse the pursuit of knowledge and character.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The disciplined lifestyle highlighted in the poem can foster a stable home environment; families that encourage personal development often enjoy greater cohesion and mutual respect.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Observing the symbols of dragons and tigers indicates awareness of societal dynamics; maintaining integrity and a keen perception of public sentiment can protect one’s reputation and build lasting respect within the community.",
