    "en": "This poem's theme is the harmonious resonance between scholarship and national prosperity. Beginning with the cold study room, the author portrays a scholar who, despite harsh conditions, persists until he reaches the moment of flourishing. The clear sun and the enslaved person symbolize enlightenment reaching everyone, allowing all to see true knowledge. The harmony between court and countryside, accompanied by the joy of fish and birds, reflects smooth governance, peaceful citizens, and even the natural world rejoicing. Finally, the top scholar bows to the minister, celebrating harmonious prosperity, emphasizing that virtuous governance and harmony bring long‑term stability. Overall, the poem uses four concise lines to convey a profound meaning: only by steadfast dedication to learning and harmonious governance can national prosperity and social peace be achieved. It also reminds that if the heart focuses on scholarship and governance, society will flourish like fish and dragons in water, rising steadily.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、学術と国家の繁栄の調和共鳴である。寒い窓辺の学者は苦寒の中でも諦めず、やがて繁栄の時を迎える姿を描く。清らかな太陽と奴隷が示す光は、誰もが真の知識を見ることができることを象徴し、朝野の和諧と魚鳥の喜びは、円滑な統治と市民の安寧、自然界の歓喜を表す。最後に状元は相に頭を下げ、雍熙の繁栄を祝うことで、貞治と和諧が長期的安定をもたらすことを強調する。全体として、詩は四行で簡潔に深い意味を伝え、学術と統治の調和こそが国の繁栄と社会平和をもたらすと訴える。心を学術と治世に集中すれば、社会は魚龍が水中で蒸蒸と上昇するように繁栄するだろう。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a celebration of harmonious integration between scholarly pursuit, political stability, and natural order. The verses trace the journey from the austere environment of a scholar's study to the radiant success of a top scholar who gains the emperor's favor, thereby underscoring that personal diligence combined with systemic harmony produces national prosperity. The imagery of the clear sun and the joy of fish and birds further illustrates that when governance is just and society is orderly, even the natural world partakes in the communal bliss.\n\n1. Health: The poem indirectly reminds that a balanced life—where intellectual labor is matched with rest—fosters physical resilience. The scholar's perseverance in cold conditions signals that sustained effort can lead to enduring well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The harmony between court and countryside symbolizes respectful and collaborative relationships. Mutual respect and empathy foster deeper bonds, mirroring the seamless interaction depicted.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Success is portrayed as the culmination of disciplined study and societal support. Ambition should align with communal goals; personal glory thrives when shared with the collective.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The prosperity of the nation and the flourishing of nature imply that economic abundance arises from orderly governance and equitable distribution. Financial well‑being is a byproduct of harmony, not individual greed.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem reflects domestic peace when the state functions smoothly. A family that upholds respect and cooperation experiences a calm and prosperous existence, echoing the broader harmony.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Public recognition of the scholar, as he bows to the minister, underscores the importance of reputation built on merit. Social standing grows when one contributes positively to the community, not solely through ambition.\n\nIn sum, the poem invites readers to view personal achievements as intrinsically linked to the welfare of the community. By fostering health, love, ambition, wealth, family harmony, and reputation through collective effort and moral governance, individuals and society together can ascend toward a flourishing future.",
