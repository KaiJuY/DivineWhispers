    "en": "This poem's theme is the importance of distinguishing right from wrong and thoughtful planning. The lines begin with \"black and white must be clear,\" implying that actions should have a clear moral line and correct judgment. Then \"their children spread across the board\" describes a chessboard full of possibilities, reminding readers to strategize amid many choices. Finally, \"you do not know the first move\" and \"waste of effort, difficult to win\" point out that without foresight and planning, even hard work cannot achieve success and may even lead to failure. The poem uses a chess metaphor to awaken people to deliberate before acting, emphasizing the order of decision-making and responsibility.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、正しいと間違いを区別し、慎重に計画することの重要性です。冒頭の「黒と白は明確にするべきだ」という言葉は、行動には明確な道徳線と正しい判断が必要であることを示唆しています。次に「子が盤面に横たわる」は、さまざまな可能性で満ちたチェスボードを描き、読者に多くの選択肢の中で戦略を立てるよう促します。最後に「あなたは最初の手を知らない」と「努力は無駄で勝ちにくい」は、先の見通しと計画がなければ、たとえ努力を重ねても成功できず、失敗につながる可能性があることを示しています。全体として、チェスの比喩を用いて、行動前に熟慮し、決定と実行の順序と責任を強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that success in any endeavor hinges on clear discernment between right and wrong and on the foresight to plan before acting. The lines depict a chessboard, a metaphor for life’s complex choices, emphasizing that a lack of strategic thinking leads to wasted effort and inevitable defeat. The poem warns against impulsive decisions that disregard moral clarity, encouraging a measured approach rooted in anticipation and preparation.\n\n1. Health – The poem’s call for clear distinction mirrors the need to recognize healthy versus harmful habits. Ignoring this can lead to wasted energy and potential illness. A disciplined, well‑planned lifestyle promotes resilience.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – Just as a chess game requires careful planning, relationships thrive on thoughtful communication. Hastily made promises or misread intentions can result in misunderstandings, while deliberate actions foster trust and harmony.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – The admonition to know the first move parallels career strategy. Acting without a clear goal or roadmap wastes effort; setting milestones and anticipating obstacles increases the likelihood of achievement.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – Financial success demands clear criteria for investments and expenditures. The poem’s warning against blind action reminds us to evaluate risks, research thoroughly, and avoid impulsive spending that could jeopardize long‑term stability.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – Within the family unit, clear boundaries and shared expectations create a supportive environment. A lack of forethought can spark conflict, while thoughtful planning of roles and responsibilities strengthens bonds.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – Public perception often hinges on consistent, principled behavior. The poem urges individuals to consider the consequences of their actions before stepping into the spotlight, thereby preserving credibility and fostering respectful alliances.",
