    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對於商機與財運的洞察，以及在旅途中與家園之間的平衡。詩中以龍宮的莊嚴象徵高貴與命運的召喚，隨即敘述君子趁著航行之際出行，寓意把握時機。財積如山，暗示因勤勞與慧眼而聚財，令旁人羨慕。最後提及到家正值燕子呢喃，寓意歸來之際得到家人與自然的和諧，象徵收穫與安寧。整體上此詩提醒人們，成功需同時把握市場機會與內心平衡，並在適時歸鄉與家人相聚，才能獲得長遠的福祉。",

The poem uses the solemnity of the Dragon Palace to symbolize nobility and destiny’s call, then describes the gentleman setting out on a voyage, implying the importance of seizing the right moment.

Finally, the arrival at home coincides with the chirping of swallows, signifying harmony with family and nature upon return, symbolizing harvest and peace. Overall, the poem reminds us that success requires both seizing market opportunities and maintaining inner equilibrium, and that timely return to one’s hometown and family leads to lasting well‑being.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、商機と財運への洞察、および旅と家の間のバランスにあります。詩は龍宮の荘厳さを高貴と運命の呼び声の象徴として用い、続いて商人が航海の機会を利用して出発する様子を描写し、タイミングを掴む重要性を示しています。財は山のように積もり、勤勉と鋭い洞察が豊かさをもたらすことを暗示し、他者の羨望を呼びます。最後に、家に到着したときに燕のさえずりが聞こえると、帰還と家族や自然との調和が示され、収穫と平和を象徴します。全体として、詩は成功が市場機会を掴むことと内なるバランスを保つことの両方を要求し、タイムリーに故郷や家族と再会することで長期的な幸福を得られると示唆しています。",
