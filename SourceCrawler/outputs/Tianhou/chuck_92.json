  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that patience, thorough contemplation, and the wisdom of historical exemplars such as Zhang Liang (留侯) guide one toward balanced action in all facets of life. The verses caution against impulsive decisions, urging repeated review and careful consideration before proceeding. By invoking the sage’s measured approach, the poem emphasizes humility, respect for others, and the importance of steady progress over sudden ambition.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s advice to refrain from rash actions implies a prudent lifestyle that safeguards physical well‑being. By consistently assessing one’s plans, one can avoid stressful or hazardous decisions, fostering a stable, health‑conducive routine.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The admonition against “輕唐突” (light, abrupt behavior) underlines the value of thoughtful communication. Maintaining a calm, reflective stance nurtures trust and reduces conflicts within intimate bonds.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The counsel to “三覆細尋思” mirrors professional diligence: evaluating goals multiple times before committing. This methodical path leads to long‑term success rather than fleeting, ill‑fated endeavors.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Impulsive financial moves are discouraged; instead, a measured, review‑heavy strategy is promoted. This reduces risk, ensures sound investments, and allows for steady wealth accumulation.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The poem’s emphasis on humility and patience resonates with family dynamics. By approaching family matters with calm deliberation, one supports harmony and mutual respect among members.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Acting with restraint and careful reflection enhances one’s reputation. The model of Zhang Liang, who earned respect through prudence, serves as a reminder that consistency and thoughtfulness are key to positive social standing.",
