    "zh": "This poem's theme is the intertwining of fate and wealth. The entire poem begins with 'to everywhere generate wealth, people do not know', indicating that although opportunities to earn money exist everywhere, not everyone can perceive the hidden intricacies. Next, 'why bother to desire and seek far away' reminds us that there is no need to strive for distant luxury, but rather to follow the natural flow of destiny. 'One two pieces of gold equals four pieces of fortune' implies the disparity between the value of money and the value of blessings; treating money as supreme tends to cause loss of innate gifts. The final line 'not as destiny itself uneven' reminds that worldly affairs are volatile, wealth is difficult to fully control, and destiny is ultimately the ruler. Overall, the poem contrasts wealth and destiny, emphasizing the importance of following nature, maintaining moderation, and warning against excessive pursuit of wealth which leads to imbalance.

    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運命と富の相互作用である。詩全体は「どこでも富を生み出す人は知らない」で始まり、富を得る機会はあらゆる場所にあるが、誰もその隠された複雑さを把握できるわけではないことを示している。次に「遠く奢望を求めるな」と人々に遠くの贅沢を追い求める必要はなく、むしろ運命の流れに従うべきだと警告している。『一つの金は四つの福と同じ価値』は金銭と福の価値の差を暗示し、金を最高とみなすと本来の才能を失う恐れがある。最後の一文「命運本来は参差している」は世間の事象が変動し、富を完全に掌握することは難しく、運命こそが最終的な支配者であることを思い起こさせる。全体として、詩は富と運命を対比し、自然に従い、節度を保つ重要性を強調し、過度な富の追求が不均衡を招くと警告している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the pursuit of wealth, though seemingly abundant, is ultimately subject to the vagaries of destiny; it cautions against overreaching for distant luxuries and encourages a balanced, fate‑aligned approach to life. The poem juxtaposes the allure of material gain with the unpredictability of fortune, urging the reader to recognize that true blessing is not measured solely by gold but by a harmonious acceptance of one’s allotted circumstances.\n\n1. Health\nThe verses remind us that unchecked ambition can erode well‑being. When the mind becomes consumed by the chase for riches, neglect of body and mind follows. Maintaining moderation keeps physical resilience intact, allowing one to cope with the inevitable ups and downs of fortune.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nA focus on external gain may alienate those around us. The poem suggests that love flourishes when we are not preoccupied with distant aspirations. By aligning personal aspirations with a humble, grounded attitude, relationships gain depth and sincerity.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nAmbition is valuable only when tempered by realism. The poem warns that striving for \"far‑off luxuries\" can derail professional progress. A measured pursuit of career goals, coupled with an acceptance of inevitable setbacks, yields sustainable growth.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nMoney is described as a fleeting element subject to fate. The lesson is that wealth should be viewed as a tool rather than an end. Wise financial stewardship involves prudent saving, moderate spending, and a readiness to adapt when circumstances shift.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily stability hinges on balance between personal ambition and collective well‑being. Over‑aspiration can strain family ties. The poem encourages fostering harmony by recognizing that family blessings are earned through shared patience and acceptance of fate.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nPublic reputation thrives on authenticity and reliability, not on the illusion of distant success. The poem cautions against projecting a facade of wealth. Genuine connections grow when one presents a balanced persona grounded in humility and an acceptance of life’s natural rhythms.",
