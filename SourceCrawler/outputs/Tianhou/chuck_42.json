    "en": "This poem's theme is the celebration of wealth and health, implying that a virtuous person leads a smooth life. In the verse, the line 'Tenfold wealth joy comes to your home' portrays flourishing fortune, followed by 'The pipe takes a lifetime of health and peace' which explains physical wellbeing and inner tranquility. The breeze of spring, and the line 'The spring breeze pervades the forest flowers' symbolize prosperity and joy. The entire poem is presented in concise four lines, emphasizing smoothness and auspiciousness, and subtly suggesting that career, family, and interpersonal relationships will all receive blessings. Here, wealth and health are positioned side by side as the dual foundations of personal achievement. Each line sketches how money brings comfort, body brings serenity, and spring breezes bring delight, forming a complete cycle of welfare. A virtuous person follows destiny and can use this to act advantageously, ultimately achieving career prosperity, familial harmony, while also remembering inner peace and external goodwill.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、財と健康の祝福であり、徳ある人の人生が順調であることを示唆しています。詩中の「十分財喜到君家」は財運の繁栄を描き、「管取一生康且泰」は身体の健康と心の安寧を説明しています。春風が吹き、また「春風看徧上林花」は繁栄と喜びを象徴します。詩全体は簡潔な四行で構成され、順調さと吉祥を強調し、事業・家庭・人間関係すべてに祝福が訪れることを暗示しています。ここでは、財と健康が人生の達成の二重基盤として並べられています。各行は金銭の安寧、身体の静寂、春風の喜びを描き、福祉の完全な循環を形成しています。徳ある者は運命に従い、機会を活かすことで、最終的に事業の繁栄、家庭の和み、内なる平和と外への善意を忘れずに成し遂げるのです。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a concise blessing that intertwines material prosperity, physical wellbeing, and the gentle assurance of nature’s renewal, suggesting that harmony arises when wealth, health, and joy coexist in a balanced cycle. The verses celebrate a life where fortune is welcomed, health is maintained, and the simple pleasures of spring serve as reminders of continuity and optimism. This balanced perspective encourages the reader to seek harmony across all aspects of existence, recognizing that true fortune is not merely monetary but also encompasses inner peace and communal harmony.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s emphasis on “管取一生康且泰” highlights the significance of lifelong physical and mental well‑being. By acknowledging that health is a foundational pillar of success, it reminds readers to prioritize regular self‑care, balanced nutrition, and mindful habits. A sustained state of wellness empowers individuals to pursue ambitions without being hindered by illness or fatigue.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe all‑encompassing blessing implies that affectionate bonds thrive when wealth and health are secure. The imagery of spring blossoms sweeping through the forest evokes mutual growth, shared joy, and the nurturing of companionship. Maintaining harmony within relationships demands the same balanced attention to emotional and material needs as indicated in the poem.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nBy stating that wealth arrives “十分財喜到君家,” the poem signals that professional success will be rewarded. The poet encourages a proactive stance, suggesting that ambition combined with a healthy foundation leads to sustainable achievements. This perspective encourages strategic planning and disciplined effort in one’s chosen field.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nThe phrase “十分財喜” directly points to abundant financial gain. However, the poem frames wealth as a supportive element rather than an end. Readers are advised to manage resources wisely, ensuring that monetary prosperity enhances rather than disrupts overall wellbeing.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe allusion to spring flowers “春風看徧上林花” reflects communal flourishing. The poem underscores that familial peace is cultivated when health and wealth are balanced, fostering environments where members can grow together. It invites collective appreciation of shared blessings.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nFinally, the verses suggest that with health and fortune, one attracts respectful regard from others. By maintaining integrity and kindness, the poem indicates that reputation will naturally flourish. A strong social network becomes a reinforcing cycle of mutual support and collective happiness.",
