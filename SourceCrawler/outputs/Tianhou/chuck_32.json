    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於修煉結成、身心清淨與對未來與名利情感之抉擇的省思。詩中以「九轉丹砂」象徵九次循環的內在修練，終於達成「功已成」的成就。隨後提及「臨風牽動覺身清」，描繪風中感受身體清澈，暗示修煉後的身心平靜。此詩以簡練的語句描繪修煉之路，從內在的苦行到外在的感知，皆以「轉」字寓意循環與升華；「九轉丹砂」亦暗指道家煉丹之九重功課，完成後的「功已成」不僅是物質上的成就，更是心靈上的安定。風的象徵則傳遞著自然之力與人間情感的交錯，提醒修者在清淨的同時，勿失對情感的敏銳。最後的詢問與回應，映射出世俗對未來的期待與個人對名利情感之間的權衡，提出在追逐成功的道路上，保持內心的純粹與外在的真誠同等重要。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the completion of inner cultivation, the clarity of body and mind, and the contemplation of the balance between future prospects, fame, fortune, and emotions. In the poem, the phrase \"nine turns of cinnabar\" symbolizes nine cycles of inner practice, culminating in the achievement of \"the work has already been completed.\" The subsequent line \"standing in the wind, feeling the body clear\" depicts a sense of clarity in the wind, indicating the tranquility of body and mind after cultivation. The poem uses concise language to portray the path of cultivation, from inner hardships to external perception, each \"turn\" representing cycles and elevation; \"nine turns of cinnabar\" also hints at the nine levels of alchemical practice in Taoist tradition, and the completion of \"the work has already been completed\" is not only a material achievement but also a spiritual stability. The wind symbolizes the interplay between natural forces and human emotions, reminding practitioners to maintain sensitivity to emotions while achieving inner purity. The final query and response reflect societal expectations for the future and personal weighing of fame and fortune against emotions, suggesting that on the road to success one must maintain both inner purity and external sincerity equally.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、内なる修行の完成、身体と心の清澄さ、そして未来の展望や名誉・財産、感情のバランスを考えることです。『九転丹砂』という表現は、内なる修行の九つのサイクルを象徴し、やがて『功が成った』という達成を示しています。次の行『風に立ち、身体が澄んでいるのを感じる』は、風の中での清澄な感覚を描き、修行後の身体と心の静寂を示しています。最後に『誰かが私の未来を尋ねる、名誉と財産の途中を感情と呼ぶ』という一節は、外部からの未来への関心と、名誉・財産と感情の関係についての自己の省察を反映し、成功を追求しながらも感情の本質を忘れないようにというメッセージを伝えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the speaker has successfully completed a profound inner transformation, symbolized by the “nine turns of cinnabar,” and now perceives a clear, balanced state of body and mind. The wind motif illustrates how external circumstances can stir the cultivated consciousness, yet the sense of clarity remains intact. When others inquire about the future, the speaker reflects on the tension between external acclaim—fame and fortune—and the inner emotional realm. The poem thus invites contemplation on maintaining inner purity while navigating worldly ambitions and personal relationships.\n\n1. Health\n   The completion of inner cultivation yields physical vitality and mental steadiness. The wind represents external pressures that can disturb but do not erode this balance, encouraging regular practices that preserve clarity and resilience.\nürger2. Wealth\n   Fame and fortune are portrayed as transient rewards. Maintaining a disciplined mindset prevents greed and ensures that material pursuits remain harmonious with one’s deeper values.\n\n2. Career & Ambition\n   Inquiry into the future highlights the need for purpose beyond accolades. Setting goals that align with personal integrity fosters sustainable success rather than fleeting acclaim.\n\n3. Relationships\n   Emotions are placed in the center of the speaker’s life, suggesting that genuine connection requires balance between affection and achievement. Listening attentively to loved ones while honoring one’s inner state strengthens mutual respect.\n\n4. Spiritual Well‑Being\n   The poem’s alchemical imagery points to ongoing self‑development. Cultivating insight through meditation or breathwork keeps the spirit centered amid changing external winds.\n\n5. Time Management\n   The clear body‑mind state encourages prioritizing activities that support both personal and professional growth. Allocating time for reflection prevents over‑commitment to fame or profit.\n\n6. Personal Growth\n   The tension between fame, fortune, and emotion underscores the importance of self‑awareness. Continual self‑evaluation ensures that ambition remains aligned with authentic emotional needs, sustaining holistic development.",
