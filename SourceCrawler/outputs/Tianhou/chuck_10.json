    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對人生循環與遲延所帶來的遺憾與自省。作者以泰極、尋環作為象徵，暗示在追求卓越與循環中，往往忽略了自我內在的需求。首句「泰極否來汝不知」表明高峰不在外在，卻被自我迷惑所阻；第二句「尋環往復道無私」則指出環環相扣的道路缺乏真誠，難以得到心靈的安寧。回想昔日風光好，雖有過往美好，但作者因遲遲未能把握機會，深感悔恨，進而反思自我。整體而言，詩歌勸人應該把握當下，切莫因循環之間的迷失而錯失機會。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the regret and introspection that arise from life's cycles and delays. The author uses \"Tai Ji\" and \"searching loop\" as symbols, suggesting that in pursuit of excellence and cycles, one often overlooks inner needs. The first line, \"When the apex comes, you do not know,\" indicates that greatness lies not externally, yet is hindered by self-illusion; the second line, \"Seek the loop, the path goes in circles, lacking selflessness,\" points out that interconnected paths are devoid of sincerity, making it hard to attain inner peace. Reflecting on the former splendor, although there was past beauty, the author feels remorse for not seizing the opportunity, thus turning to self-reflection. Overall, the poem urges people to seize the present and not miss chances due to being lost in cycles.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは人生の循環と遅延から生じる後悔と内省です。作者は『太極』と『探すループ』を象徴として用い、卓越と循環を追求する中で、しばしば内なるニーズを見落としてしまうことを示唆しています。最初の行『泰極否来汝不知』は、栄光は外にあるのではなく、自己の幻想に阻まれていることを示しています。第二の行『尋環往復道無私』は、相互に絡み合った道が真摯さを欠き、内なる安らぎを得ることが難しいと指摘しています。過去の美しさを思い返し、機会を掴めずに悔やんでいる作者は、自らを省みることに至ります。全体として、詩は人々に現在を掴み、循環に迷い込むことでチャンスを逃さないよう促しています",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the pursuit of high aspirations and repetitive cycles can blind individuals to the present moment, leading to regret and missed opportunities. The verses remind us that success and inner fulfillment depend not solely on external achievements, but also on genuine self‑awareness and timely action. They caution against getting caught in endless loops of routine and self‑deception, urging a more deliberate and conscious approach to life’s journey.\n\n1. Health: The poem’s warning about delayed action reflects on health, suggesting that neglecting timely care or preventive measures can culminate in serious ailments. It encourages regular reflection on one’s body and mind, and taking proactive steps—like balanced nutrition, exercise, and mindfulness—to prevent chronic conditions. By staying present, we avoid letting minor discomforts become major health setbacks.\n\n2.

It advises cultivating honest communication and recognizing when to step out of old loops. By embracing change and being attentive to partners’ needs, one can break stagnation and foster deeper intimacy.\n\n3.
