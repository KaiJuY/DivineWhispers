    "zh": "這首詩的主題是「成就與羨慕的雙刃劍」。作者以牡丹花盛開時的艷麗，象徵人生或事業的輝煌，卻以「妬花風雨」描繪嫉妒與外界壓力，將本應燦爛的花瓣瞬間化為泥沙。詩中將「風雨」與「妬」相提並論，暗示外在負面情緒會摧毀個人光芒，提醒人們應以寬闊心胸迎接挑戰，才能在逆境中保持自我光彩。在此背景下，詩人暗喻若不及時排解嫉妒之風，將不僅傷害自我，也可能令周遭同樣被汙染。故此，詩句勸人以自省與修養，將風雨化作前進動力，方能在風雨過後，重拾牡丹的盛華。此詩亦顯示人心若被羨慕侵蝕，最終可能如同被風暴洗禮的樹枝，失去枝葉，無法再綻放光彩。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is \"The Double-Edged Sword of Achievement and Envy.\" The poet uses the blooming peony to symbolize the brilliance of personal success or career, yet portrays envy as a storm that turns the bright petals into mud. The poem equates wind and envy, implying that negative external forces can destroy one's brilliance, urging readers to meet challenges with an open heart to keep their own glow. In this context, the poet hints that failure to dispel envy may not only harm oneself but also contaminate those around. Thus, the poem advises self-reflection and cultivation, turning the storm into a driving force, enabling a restoration of the peony's splendor after the rain. The poem also shows that if hoewel the heart is eroded by jealousy, it may end up like a tree branch washed by a storm, losing leaves and unable to shine again.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは「成功と妬みの両刃」です。作者は、牡丹の開花を個人の成功やキャリアの輝きを象徴として描き、妬みを風のような嵐として、明るい花びらを泥に変える様子を表現しています。詩は風と妬みを同列に置き、外部の否定的な力が人の輝きを破壊し得ることを示し、読者にオープンな心で挑戦に立ち向かい自らの輝きを保つよう促しています。こうした文脈で、作者は妬みを払拭できない場合、自身だけでなく周囲も汚染される可能性があると示唆しています。したがって、詩は自己反省と修養を勧め、嵐を前進の力に変えることで、雨が過ぎた後に牡丹の輝きを取り戻せると語っています。また、詩は妬みで心が侵食されると、嵐に洗われた枝のように葉を失い、再び輝けなくなる可能性を示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a stark reminder that success and the envy it attracts can act as a double‑edged sword, cutting both ways. It illustrates how external pressures, if left unchecked, can erode personal brilliance and spread negativity to those around. By encouraging self‑reflection and the conversion of turmoil into motivation, the poet offers a path back to a renewed sense of accomplishment and inner glow.\n\n**Health**\n- Envy can manifest as stress or anxiety that undermines physical well‑being, leading to fatigue or loss of vitality. Recognizing this, the poem urges openness and resilience, which can help maintain a healthy balance of energy. When one confronts negative emotions, they can transform them into constructive force, thereby protecting both mind and body.\n\n**Love**\n- Jealousy threatens to corrode intimate bonds, leaving partners feeling disconnected and desolate. The poem advises honest communication and self‑reflection to purge envy before it permeates the relationship. When jealousy is confronted early, partners can rebuild trust and restore mutual affection, just as the peony regains its brilliance after the storm.\n\n**Career**\n- Professional ambition may attract envy, which can sabotage confidence and diminish productivity. By confronting these emotions head‑on, individuals can harness the challenge as a catalyst for growth. Turning criticism or competition into motivation allows one to emerge from setbacks with renewed purpose and renewed career momentum.\n\n**Financial**\n- Envy may lead to misguided decisions such as envy‑driven risk taking or misaligned investments. Recognizing these impulses and adopting disciplined reflection can prevent financial erosion. The poem’s call to channel turmoil into constructive energy aligns with prudent budgeting and strategic wealth‑building practices.\n\n**Social**\n- Jealousy can spread discord among friends and colleagues, eroding trust and camaraderie. The poem’s message to transform external negativity into forward momentum helps maintain healthy social dynamics. When individuals act with openness and empathy, they create a supportive environment that shields against social fragmentation.\n\n**Spiritual**\n- Spiritual growth is threatened when ego and envy erode the inner self, much like a branch losing its leaves. The poem emphasizes the importance of inner cultivation, self‑reflection, and turning adversity into a learning experience. By confronting envy and letting it transform into a source of insight, one can regain a spiritual sense of purpose and radiate inner light.\n\nIn sum, the poem’s metaphoric use of the peony illustrates that both triumph and envy can shape our lives profoundly; confronting envy head‑on and turning it into constructive energy preserves personal brilliance across all facets of life.",
