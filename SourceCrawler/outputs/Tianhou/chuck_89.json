    "zh": "這首詩的主題是心念與供奉之間的關係。詩中以東舍烹牛、禱不靈為例，指出單純的祭祀方式若缺乏真誠意念，往往難以得到上天回應；相較之下，西舍點青燈，意即以淨化、祥和之象徵來供奉，便能喚起神祇的關注。上句「上天感應憑方寸」說明只需一小段心念，即能觸發天地能量；「一念精誠神鬼欣」進一步強調，心念真切、精神專注，神靈亦會喜悅、回應。整體而言，詩句呼籲行事須以純正、專注的心態對待，才能在無形之中與天地、神祇達成共鳴。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the relationship between sincerity in worship and divine response. The verses illustrate that merely cooking ox in the east hall and praying may fail if lacking true devotion; in contrast, lighting green lamps in the west hall symbolizes purification and harmony, thereby attracting divine attention. The line 'Heaven responds through the palm' indicates that a mere thought can activate celestial energy; 'A single sincere thought delights the spirits' further emphasizes that true intent and focused mind invite divine pleasure and response. Overall, the poem urges that one must approach actions with pure, dedicated mindset to resonate with heaven and spirits in subtle ways.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは献拝の誠実さと神の応答との関係です。詩は、東の廳で牛を焼き祈るだけでは真摯な意図が欠けていると応じられないことを示し、対照的に西の廳で緑の灯を灯すことが浄化と和を象徴し、神々の注意を引くと説明しています。「天は指先で応答する」という句は、ほんの一つの思考で天のエネルギーを呼び起こすことを示し、「一つの真心の思考は神々を喜ばせる」という句は、真実の意図と集中した心が神々の喜びと応答を招くことを強調しています。全体として、詩は純粋で献身的な心で行動することが、天と神々と微妙に共鳴する鍵であると訴えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that sincere intention and mindful focus in ritual practices are essential for divine responsiveness. It contrasts a simple, possibly impersonal act of cooking and praying in the east hall, which fails to elicit heavenly attention, with a more symbolic, purification-centered gesture of lighting green lamps in the west hall that successfully attracts divine favor. The poet emphasizes that a single, deliberate thought—akin to a tiny palm of intention—can trigger celestial energies, and that genuine, focused conviction brings delight to spirits. The poem ultimately serves as a reminder that actions performed with purity and dedication will resonate subtly with the heavens and the divine realm.\n\n**Health**\n- The poem suggests that genuine inner intention can positively influence one's physical well-being. By fostering a clear, sincere mindset, a person may experience reduced stress and improved resilience, thereby supporting overall health.\n\n**Love and Relationships**\n- In interpersonal contexts, sincere communication and thoughtful gestures are likely to be reciprocated with warmth and understanding.
