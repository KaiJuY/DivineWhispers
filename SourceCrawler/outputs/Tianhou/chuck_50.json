  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the individual’s career is predetermined and destined for great success through perseverance, strategic adaptation, and overcoming obstacles, culminating in extraordinary longevity. The imagery of moving east and then south symbolizes a progressive expansion of influence and ambition. The phrase \"取坎填離\" underscores the ability to transform challenges into opportunities, suggesting a proactive mindset. The concluding line about longevity and immortality presents the person as an exceptional figure, implying lasting impact and resilience beyond ordinary limits.\n\n1. Health: The reference to longevity indicates a strong physical foundation; however, maintaining balance through steady progress is crucial to avoid fatigue from rapid expansion.\n2. Love and Relationships: As the poem emphasizes predetermined paths, partnerships should align with the individual’s mission, requiring mutual support for both personal growth and shared goals.\n3. Career and Ambition: The narrative encourages a strategic approach—start in the east, broaden horizons to the south, and convert obstacles into stepping stones—leading to a sustained trajectory of professional excellence.\n4. Wealth and Finances: Implicit in the successful completion of a “great enterprise” is financial prosperity, yet prudent management of resources ensures that wealth supports continued growth rather than stagnation.\n5. Family and Harmony: The focus on predetermined destiny and overcoming barriers suggests the need for a supportive family environment; shared vision and resilience strengthen intra-family bonds.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Expanding influence from east to south indicates growing social networks; building reputation through integrity and turning adversity into achievements will cement lasting respect and goodwill.",
