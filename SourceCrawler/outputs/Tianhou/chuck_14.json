  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that persistent dedication over a prolonged period, represented by the ten years of quiet study behind a window, ultimately leads to a profound personal transformation and a sense of freedom from sorrow. The poet juxtaposes the arduous inner cultivation with the exhilarating outward adventure, suggesting that true progress arises from harmonizing internal resolve with external action. The imagery of a thousand‑mile wind symbolises expansive confidence and satisfaction, while the final line’s “direct ascent to the other shore” conveys that genuine accomplishment erodes lingering anxieties, allowing the soul to rest in tranquility.\n\n1. **Health**\nThe poem promotes a disciplined, long‑term approach to well‑being. By dedicating ten years to inner cultivation, the narrator shows that sustained effort is essential for achieving lasting mental and emotional health, reducing internal turbulence and fostering peace.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships**\nThe sense of liberation expressed in the poem encourages nurturing relationships that support personal growth.
