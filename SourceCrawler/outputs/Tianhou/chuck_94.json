    "zh": "這首詩的主題是描述一位漁父因福薄緣少，昔日曾入桃源，今日再來卻無處可去，映照人生變遷與命運無常。詩中以桃源象徵理想與安寧的境界，漁父昔日與雞黍相伴，笑語喧闐，展現昔日的歡愉與社交。轉折處「今日再來無覓處」表明昔日的桃源不再，漁父已失去原有的樂土，情境帶有失落與無奈。『都因福薄與緣慳』直接指出失落的根源，福 जिसके 稀薄、緣分稀少，強調命運的不公平與人事無常。詩句中的「雞黍」則暗喻生活的基本物資與人際關係，說明漁父的生活曾以這些簡樸之物為依歸。透過簡短的四句，詩人提醒讀者應珍惜現有福氣，勿因緣薄而失去心中之樂。總體來說，詩歌以淡雅的筆觸，呈現一個因命運波折而失去桃源的漁父形象，並勸人關注福祉與緣份。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is to describe a fisherman whose fortune is thin and whose connections are few; he once entered a peach garden, but today he returns with nowhere to go, reflecting the changes in life and the impermanence of fate. In the poem, the peach garden symbolizes an ideal and peaceful realm, and the fisherman once accompanied the chicken and millet, laughing loudly, depicting his former joy and social life. The turning point, 'today he returns again but finds no place', indicates that the former peach garden is no longer there; the fisherman has lost his previous haven, evoking a sense of loss and helplessness. The line 'because of thin fortune and scanty connection' directly points to the root of the loss, emphasizing the unfairness of fate and the fickleness of human affairs. The 'chicken and millet' in the poem metaphorically signify basic sustenance and interpersonal relations, indicating that the fisherman's life once relied on these simple things. Through the brief four lines, the poet reminds readers to cherish the current fortune and not to lose the inner joy because of scarce connections. Overall, the poem presents, with a gentle tone, a fisherman who loses his peach garden due to the twists of destiny, urging people to pay attention to well‑being and bonds.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、福が薄く縁が少ない漁師を描き、かつて桃源に入ったが、今日再び来ると行き所がなくなり、人生の変化と運命の無常を映し出すことである。詩中で桃源は理想と安寧の境地を象徴し、漁師は昔、鶏と黍とともに笑い声をあげ、喜びと社交を示した。『今日再来無覓處』という転換点は、昔の桃源がもはや存在しないことを示し、漁師は以前の楽土を失い、失望と無力感を呼び起こす。『福薄與緣慳』は失落の根源を直接指し、運命の不公平さと人事の無常さを強調する。詩中の「鶏と黍」は、生活の基本的な物資と人間関係を比喩し、漁師の生活がこれらの単純なものに依存していたことを示す。四句の短い詩は、読者に現在の福を大切にし、縁が少ないために内なる喜びを失わないよう促す。総じて、この詩は穏やかな筆致で、運命の波折により桃源を失った漁師を描き、幸福と絆に注意を払うよう勧めている。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that a once‑joyful fisherman has lost his haven of peace because of thin fortune and scarce connections. The imagery of a peach garden and the companionship of a chicken and millet symbolize ideal harmony and basic sustenance, while the abrupt disappearance of the garden highlights the fleeting nature of happiness and the unpredictability of fate. The lines remind the reader to value existing blessings and to avoid complacency, for even the most serene life can crumble when luck wanes and relationships fade.\n\n**1. Health**\nThe poem suggests that inner health can sustain one through external hardship. By cultivating resilience and self‑care, a person can maintain physical and mental well‑being even when external fortune declines.\n\n**2. Love and Relationships**\nThe loss of the peach garden underscores the fragility of human bonds. Nurturing connections, showing gratitude, and appreciating everyday companions like the chicken and millet help keep emotional ties strong.\n\n**3. Career and Ambition**\nThe fisherman's experience illustrates that professional advancement relies on both luck and a supportive network. Building adaptable skills and fostering relationships can buffer against sudden loss of opportunities.\n\n**4. Wealth and Finances**\nThe line about thin fortune signals that material abundance may be temporary. Prudent financial planning, diversification, and cautious spending can mitigate the impact when resources dwindle.\n\n**5. Family and Harmony**\nThe poem’s focus on the fisherman’s solitude highlights the importance of familial support. Open communication and mutual care within the family can sustain harmony when external comforts fade.\n\n**6. Social Connections and Reputation**\nThe reference to scarce connections warns that reputation depends on community ties. Maintaining social visibility and goodwill ensures resilience during periods of adversity.\n\nEach of these aspects is interwoven with the central theme: that fleeting blessings, when coupled with weak ties, can leave one vulnerable to misfortune. The poem urges a proactive stance—valuing what one has, nurturing relationships, and preparing for change—to sustain well‑being across all life domains.",
