    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於天命與自律。詩中指出，世間萬物皆有其自然主宰，凡人不應奪取本不屬於自己的部分。即便是天生的英雄豪傑，也必須遵循規矩，順其天理行事，否則便會招致災禍。詩意在於提醒人們應以正當的手段求取利益，守住分寸，避免妄為。若不慎違反天道，將面臨訴訟、疾病、婚姻不順等不利結果，亦必須以禱禳或諫戒自律。總結而言，詩歌以簡練的語句闡述了「順天而行、守分以安」的哲理，警示人們不應逆天行事。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about destiny and self‑discipline. The verses state that every thing in the world has its own natural master, and a person should not seize that which does not belong to them. Even a born hero must obey rules and act according to the will of Heaven; otherwise disaster follows. The intent of the poem is to remind readers that gains should be pursued by proper means, keeping one’s limits and avoiding overreaching. If one deviates from the divine order, lawsuits, illness, and marital troubles may arise, and one must rectify through prayer or self‑remorse. In sum, the poem succinctly conveys the philosophy of “follow Heaven, guard one’s share, and find peace,” warning against rebellious conduct.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運命と自己規律についてです。詩は、世の中の万物にはそれぞれ自然な主宰があり、人は自分に属さないものを奪うべきではないと示しています。たとえ天生の英雄であっても、規則に従い天の意に沿って行動すべきで、そうしなければ災いが起こります。詩の意図は、正当な手段で利益を得て、限度を守り、妄想を避けるように促すことです。天の道に逆らえば訴訟、病気、結婚の不調など不利益が生じ、祈りや戒めによって自己規律を正す必要があります。まとめると、詩は「天に従い分寸を守って安寧を得る」哲学を簡潔に表現し、逆行行為を警戒するよう告げています.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that everything in the world operates under its own inherent order, and individuals should respect that order by refraining from seizing what does not belong to them. The verses caution that even the most naturally gifted hero must act within established rules; any deviation from the divine will invites calamity. The poem thus promotes a philosophy of balance: pursue ambitions through legitimate means, maintain personal boundaries, and heed the subtle cues of fate.\n\n1. Health: The poem warns that disregarding natural limits can lead to illness. By respecting the “one grain, one hair” principle, one maintains physical well‑being. Regular reflection on one’s boundaries can prevent disease.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: Misappropriating what is not one’s can damage trust. The admonition to avoid overreach encourages fairness in partnerships. Healthy relationships thrive on respecting each other’s space.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Even heroes must follow rules; ambition without discipline can backfire. The poem advises pursuing goals within ethical limits. A balanced approach ensures sustainable success.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Gains obtained by force or deceit are unstable. The verses stress legitimate acquisition and guarding one’s share. Responsible financial practices arise from honoring this principle.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Overstepping boundaries can cause family discord. The poem’s counsel to keep within one’s domain preserves harmony. Respect for each family member’s role sustains unity.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The warning against “stealing what isn’t yours” protects social standing. A reputation built on fairness resists backlash. Maintaining integrity in public life aligns with the poem’s message.",
