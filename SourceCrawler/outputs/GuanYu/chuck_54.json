    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對於雄心壯志與命運限制的反思。詩中以「萬人叢裏逞英豪」描寫作者欲在群眾中顯露英姿，隨即「便欲飛騰霄漢高」暗示極高志向。然而「爭奈承流風未便」指出雖有抱負，時勢未遂，勢必要先於身世與環境之限制。最後以「青燈黃卷且勤勞」提醒，唯有勤奮研習、修身養性，才能於後期尋得機遇。整體而言，詩句勉勵人們在逆境中堅持不懈，透過自我提升以爭取命運轉機。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that lofty ambitions often collide with the constraints of circumstance, yet perseverance and diligent self-cultivation can eventually open doors to success. The first line invites the reader to recognize the urge to distinguish oneself in a crowd of ordinary figures. The second line amplifies that urge, portraying an almost insatiable desire to reach beyond ordinary limits. The third line, however, presents an honest concession: the current moment does not favor such aspirations, implying a need to pause and reassess. The final line offers a practical remedy, suggesting that only through hard study and consistent effort can the individual overcome obstacles and realize future opportunities. Together, these verses encourage a balanced approach to ambition—combining daring aspiration with disciplined work, while accepting that timing and external factors can delay progress.\n\n1. Health: The poem warns that pursuing grand ambitions without adequate preparation can lead to strain. Readers are advised to maintain a steady routine, focusing on mental and physical resilience through disciplined study and self-care. By avoiding burnout, one can sustain the energy required for long-term goals.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The poem's candid acknowledgment of timing reflects the importance of patience in relationships. Just as ambition must wait for favorable conditions, love requires mutual readiness and respect. Couples should nurture communication and shared growth before rushing into commitments.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Ambition is celebrated but tempered by the reality of external limits. The poem encourages professionals to align aspirations with realistic timelines, seeking mentorship and skill development while awaiting appropriate opportunities. A strategic, patient approach often yields more sustainable success.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The emphasis on hard work suggests that financial prosperity is tied to diligence and continuous learning. Instead of impulsive gains, investors and entrepreneurs should focus on disciplined budgeting, incremental growth, and adapting to market shifts.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem implies that personal development benefits family dynamics. By committing to self-improvement, one can bring wisdom, patience, and stability into the household, fostering an environment where collective goals can flourish.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The stanza about standing out in a crowd warns against superficial self-promotion. Building a reputation should come from genuine skill, consistency, and integrity. Over time, steady contributions will earn respect more effectively than fleeting displays of talent.",
