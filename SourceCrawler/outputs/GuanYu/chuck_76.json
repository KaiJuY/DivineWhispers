    "zh": "這首詩的主題是法律與道德的選擇與結果。三千法律八千文，象徵社會規範與判決的繁雜，提醒人們在處理事務時必須謹慎斟酌。詩中提到「善惡兩途君自作」，說明一切行為的正負最終由個人選擇決定，並非外力所致。最後「一生禍福此中分」強調個人行為的長遠影響，正如因果報應，善行會聚福，惡行則招禍。該詩提醒讀者：在面對法律與道德抉擇時，應保持內心清醒，堅守正義，避免私欲與妄念，才能在生命中獲得平衡與安寧。若能以此為戒，將更能在社會中維持正直與善良，從而獲得他人的尊重與信任，最終走向成功與安定。",
    "en": "This poem’s theme is the choice between law and morality and their consequences. Three thousand laws and eight thousand statutes symbolize the complexity of social norms and judgments, reminding people to be cautious when handling matters. The line “善惡兩途君自作” (good and evil are both paths you choose) explains that all actions’ positive or negative outcomes ultimately depend on individual choices, not external forces. The final “一生禍福此中分” (life’s fortune and misfortune are divided within this) emphasizes the long‑term impact of personal conduct, just as karma: good deeds attract blessings, bad deeds invite disaster. The poem reminds readers that when faced with legal and moral decisions, one must keep a clear mind, uphold justice, avoid selfish desires and delusions, and thereby achieve balance and peace in life. If one takes this as a warning, one can better maintain integrity and kindness in society, earn respect and trust from others, and ultimately move toward success and stability.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは法と道徳の選択とその結果です。三千法と八千文は社会規範と判断の複雑さを象徴し、物事を扱う際に注意深く考えるように促します。「善悪二途君自作」は、善悪はすべて個人の選択に委ねられ、外部の力ではないことを示しています。最後の「一生禍福此中分」は、個人の行いが長期的に影響を与えることを強調し、カルマのように善行は福を、悪行は禍を呼びます。この詩は、法的・道徳的判断に直面したとき、心を清らかに保ち、正義を守り、私欲や妄想を避け、平衡と安寧を得るよう読者に促しています。この戒めを守れば、社会で誠実さと善良さを保ち、他者から尊敬と信頼を得て、最終的に成功と安定へと導かれます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that human life is governed by the choices one makes within the framework of law and morality, and that the outcomes of those choices—whether fortune or misfortune—are ultimately self-determined. The verse reminds that while legal statutes provide structure, it is personal agency that directs moral conduct, and that each act of good or evil has a corresponding long‑term effect, akin to the principle of cause and effect.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem suggests that a clear, righteous mindset contributes to physical well‑being; avoiding harmful impulses and adhering to ethical behavior can prevent mental and bodily ailments that arise from guilt or conflict.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – By choosing kindness and fairness, one fosters trust and harmony in interpersonal bonds. The stanza’s emphasis on personal responsibility warns against deceit, implying that honesty nurtures stronger, more enduring connections.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Success is framed not merely as professional achievement but as alignment with legal and moral standards. A career pursued with integrity attracts respect, whereas shortcuts or unethical practices invite downfall.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The verse teaches that prosperity results from lawful and benevolent conduct. Accumulating wealth through honest means secures lasting benefit, while ill‑earned gains are likely to be countered by eventual loss or misfortune.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Within the family unit, the poem urges members to act with fairness and accountability; doing so creates a stable environment that reflects the same balance between law and morality highlighted in the text.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Public perception is shaped by visible adherence to ethical principles. A reputation built on trustworthy behavior garners communal support, whereas repeated transgressions erode standing and invite criticism.\n\nOverall, the poem serves as a moral compass, guiding individuals toward self‑discipline and responsible action, which in turn fosters wellbeing across all aspects of life.",
