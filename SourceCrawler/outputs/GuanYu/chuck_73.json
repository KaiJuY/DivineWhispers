    "en": "This poem's theme is a reflection on the dissonance between past promises and present reality. The poet recalls a past harmony with the \"lan room\" where the two parties once shared a half‑silvered hairpin, yet suddenly the bond has fractured and the voices no longer resonate. With a steadfast heart the narrator hopes for a united marriage, but ultimately realizes the two are incompatible. The poem concludes with \"no harmony,\" indicating that the hoped‑for love cannot materialize and life must confront loss and readjustment.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、過去の約束と現在の現実のずれに対する感慨です。詩は、かつて『蘭房』で二人が一つの髪飾りを分かち合った調和を思い出し、しかし今や突然連絡が途絶え、声が響かなくなったと語ります。固い心で二人を結びつけたいと願いながらも、結局互いに合わないことを悟ります。詩は『事不諧』で締めくくり、望んだ愛が実現できないこと、そして人生が喪失と再調整に直面する必要があることを示唆します。",
    "reference": "昭君。歸州人。漢元帝宮女。會匈奴求婚。昭君詣闕上書請行。既嫁單于。其心未嘗忘漢。嘗上漢帝書曰。臣妾幸得備禁臠。以為身依月日。死有餘芳。豈料失意丹青。遠竄絕域。命也。奈何妾有父有弟。願君王憐而愛之。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that aspirations forged on idealized past promises may unravel when confronted with the realities of human incompatibility and the silence that follows lost communication. It speaks of a deep longing for unity—symbolized by a shared hairpin—and the painful realization that such a bond may never be achievable, leaving the heart in a state of unresolved discord.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s sense of unfulfilled connection can manifest as emotional distress, urging the reader to seek psychological balance and mindful self‑care to mitigate anxiety that arises from unmet expectations.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – It warns that sincere longing without realistic assessment can lead to disappointment; cultivating clear communication and setting mutual boundaries helps prevent future heartbreak.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The underlying message of alignment suggests that pursuing goals misaligned with one’s true values results in frustration; aligning personal ambitions with authentic strengths increases professional satisfaction.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Although not explicit, the poem implies that chasing intangible gains (like an ideal partnership) can divert resources; prudent financial planning encourages investment in tangible, realistic endeavors.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The unresolved discord highlighted here reminds families to address misunderstandings early, fostering open dialogue so that members can reconcile differences before they grow irreparable.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Maintaining credibility requires honesty about one’s capabilities and limits; overstating harmony may damage reputation, whereas sincere acknowledgment of shortcomings strengthens trust among peers.\n\nIn sum, the verses urge a conscious approach to expectation versus reality across all facets of life, promoting reflective adjustment, open communication, and emotional resilience.",
