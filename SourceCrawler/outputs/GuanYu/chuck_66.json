    "zh": "這首詩的主題是耕種於家鄉，拒絕外行，說明新運即將到來，喜氣將門庭。詩中以耕耘為比喻，寓意務實於本土，避免浪費力氣於遠方。第一句提醒不必遠尋，第二句示意今年有好兆頭，第三句呼應內外皆安，最後以雙喜迎門收尾，象徵事業、婚姻皆順。詩意簡潔，卻蘊含對生活與事業的深刻洞察。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is that cultivation should stay within one's hometown, avoiding external pursuits. The poem suggests that new fortunes are on the horizon and joy will enter the household. The first line warns against distant searching, while the second heralds auspicious times. The final lines promise dual happiness at the door, symbolizing success in career and marriage. Though brief, the poem contains profound insight into life and work.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、耕作は故郷に留め、外へ出ることを避けることです。詩は新たな幸運が近づき、喜びが門に入ることを示唆しています。第一行は遠くを探すことを戒め、第二行は吉兆を告げます。最後の行は門に双喜が訪れると約束し、職業と結婚の成功を象徴します。短いですが、人生と仕事への深い洞察を含んでいます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that true prosperity arises from staying rooted in one's own community, and that external ventures may bring little benefit while inner developments promise dual blessings. The verses use the metaphor of farming—cultivating land close to home—to emphasize diligence, patience, and the wisdom of not dispersing energies on distant pursuits. The poem’s final image of a door filled with double joy conveys a sense that the effort invested locally will yield both material and relational rewards.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem encourages a grounded lifestyle, suggesting that staying near one’s familiar surroundings can reduce stress and promote well‑being. By focusing on familiar routines and environments, individuals may experience steadier health outcomes, lessening the strain that travel or relocation can cause.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe notion of “double joy” at the doorstep hints at harmony and mutual support in close relationships. Partners who share common roots and values will likely enjoy a stable, affectionate bond that strengthens over time.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nWork within familiar settings is highlighted as a path to success. A career pursued locally, where one knows the market and has a network, will lead to steady growth rather than risky, uncertain ventures elsewhere.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial prosperity is tied to disciplined, long‑term efforts rather than quick gains. The poem’s reference to new fortunes arriving “this year” indicates that patience and continuous effort can bring gradual but reliable wealth.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nA focus on one’s hometown fosters family cohesion. By investing time and resources in the immediate community, families create a supportive environment that nurtures collective well‑being.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nReputation benefits from consistency and reliability within a familiar circle. The poem’s advice to “not seek distant opportunities” encourages building a strong local presence, thereby enhancing trust and standing among peers.",
