    "reference": "晉。山濤。字巨源。河內懷人。器量不群。小與阮藉為竹林友。武帝朝為吏部尚書。薦拔人物。王衍少時。山濤見之曰。何物老嫗生此寧馨兒。然悟天下蒼生。首必此子也。衍字夷甫。晉陽人。神姿高徹。如瑤林瓊樹。官至司徒。後為石勒所害。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is:\n- **Timing is not a concern**: Marriage and children need not be judged as late or early.\n- **Inner calm as the key**: Keeping a balanced, sincere mind invites divine support.\n- **Past karma and future reward**: By the age of forty, any previous deeds will be answered, leading to a culmination of merit.\n- **Harmonious family life**: The poem concludes with a vision of a well‑rounded life, filled with sweet children and domestic bliss.\n- **Symbolism**: The poem uses the image of a *fortune* that unfolds gradually, much like a river flowing steadily toward its destiny.",
