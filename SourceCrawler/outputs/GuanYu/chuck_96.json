    "en": "This poem's theme is a positive outlook toward marriage and offspring, emphasizing the interrelation between timing and mindset. Though offspring may not yet arrive, maintaining a calm and honest heart can attract divine protection. The line \"the karma must be fulfilled before forty\" reminds us of the cycle of cause and effect, that good deeds will be rewarded and a harmonious family will eventually be achieved with complete merit. For those unmarried, the poem also advises that waiting does not mean being late; steady determination and upright conduct will ultimately bring good fate at the right time. In summary, the poem encourages a mindful approach to life, expecting positive karma and the natural arrival of happiness.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは結婚と子孫に対する前向きな見方で、時期と心構えの相互関係を強調しています。子孫がまだ来ていなくても、平穏で正直な心を保つことで神の保護を受けることができます。「四十年前に報いを果たすべきだ」という行為は因果の循環を思い出させ、善行は報われ、調和の取れた家庭が完全な功徳で実現します。独身者に対しても、待つことは遅れていることを意味しないと詩は示唆し、安定した決意と正直な行動が適切な時に良い運命をもたらします。総じて、詩は人生に対する心構えを持ち、肯定的な因果と幸福の自然な到来を期待するよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that marriage and progeny should be approached with patience, humility, and a clear mind, trusting that virtue and divine favor will eventually materialize. The verses emphasize that a delayed birth does not signal failure; rather, it underscores the importance of inner composure and steadfast faith. They also remind the reader of the cyclical nature of karma, indicating that earlier actions will be rewarded in due course, culminating in a harmonious family life. This holistic perspective offers practical guidance across various life domains:\n\n1. **Health** – The poem encourages a balanced, calm state of mind which can positively influence physical well‑being, implying that stress relief and spiritual tranquility aid overall health.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – It advises that love will manifest when one remains patient and maintains integrity; waiting for the right partner is portrayed as a virtue rather than a flaw.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – By highlighting the eventual fruition of good deeds, the verse suggests that consistent effort and moral conduct in one’s work will lead to success and recognition over time.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The mention of divine support implies that financial stability may come from both hard work and a generous, grateful attitude, with prosperity arriving when virtue is fully realized.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The final lines celebrate a family enriched by children born after a period of patient nurturing, indicating that familial harmony is the natural outcome of sustained virtue and faithful expectations.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The poem’s focus on inner steadiness and righteous action conveys that a good reputation stems from consistent ethical behavior; social networks strengthen as a byproduct of genuine integrity.\n\nOverall, the poem serves as a reminder that patience, moral diligence, and a tranquil mindset are the keystones that unlock the blessings of health, love, career, wealth, family, and social harmony.",
