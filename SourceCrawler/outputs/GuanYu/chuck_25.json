    "en": "This poem's theme is the fluctuation of fortune and the importance of timing. The verses first describe that the years of Yin, Wu, and Xu are fraught with obstacles, while the months of Hai, Zi, and Chou are smoother; later, encountering the days or people of Mao and You is likened to a barren tree blooming in spring. The author uses celestial timing to convey that when in an unfavorable year, one must patiently wait, and when the opportune moment arrives, one can shine brightly. The four seasonal symbols represent the four stages of life, urging readers to seize opportunities, follow the flow, and avoid rashness. Moreover, the final line, “a barren tree blossoms when spring comes,” metaphorically illustrates that hidden potential surfaces in adversity, encouraging perseverance and faith. Overall, the poem employs the passage of time as a metaphor, urging people to combine patience and opportunity to achieve success.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運勢の変化と時機の重要性です。詩はまず、寅午戌年は障害が多いと述べ、亥子丑月は順調であると示します。さらに、卯酉の日や人に遭遇すると、枯れ木が春に咲くように、好転すると描かれます。作者は天の時を用いて、不利な年では忍耐が必要であり、機会が来れば輝くことができると伝えます。四季の象徴は人生の四段階を表し、読者に機会をつかみ、流れに沿って行動し、無謀さを避けるよう促します。さらに「枯れ木が春に咲く」という最後の句は、逆境で潜在力が開花することを比喩し、忍耐と信念を持つよう励まします。全体として、詩は時間の流れを比喩に使い、忍耐と機会を組み合わせて成功を達成するよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that fortune is cyclic, and the right timing combined with patient perseverance can transform obstacles into opportunities. The verses outline a pattern: years marked by the characters 寅, 午, 戌 tend to bring hindrances, whereas months associated with 亥, 子, 丑 promise smoother progress. The appearance of the days or people denoted by 卯 and 酉, likened to a barren tree blooming in spring, signals a sudden turning point where dormant potential erupts into visible success. The concluding line, ‘枯木逢春自放花’, serves as a metaphor for resilience; it reminds the reader that even in apparent desolation, hope can arise when conditions become favorable. This cyclical view encourages a balanced perspective: do not force outcomes in unfavorable periods but rather wait for the auspicious moment to act decisively.\n\n**1. Health**\nThe poem advises patience during unfavorable periods; this translates to maintaining a steady routine and avoiding stress. When circumstances improve, a sudden boost in vitality may follow, reflecting the “spring blooming” imagery. Long‑term health is thus tied to timing and consistency.\n\n**2. Love and Relationships**\nRelationship success is likened to the favorable months of 亥, 子, 丑, suggesting that timing matters in matters of the heart. Being in sync with a partner’s rhythm rather than forcing decisions leads to smoother progress. The poem implies that a patient approach yields lasting affection.\n\n**3. Career and Ambition**\nCareer advancement follows the pattern of obstacle‑heavy years and favorable seasons. When faced with professional setbacks, the guidance is to wait for the right opportunity (卯酉) before making a bold move. The imagery of the tree blooming implies that skills honed during tough times can flourish when conditions align.\n\n**4. Wealth and Finances**\nFinancial gains are deferred until the auspicious months; the poem cautions against hasty investments during “obstructed” periods. Prudence and timing create a favorable environment for wealth accumulation, mirroring the blooming metaphor.\n\n**5. Family and Harmony**\nFamily harmony thrives when members respect the natural flow of time. Avoiding forceful interventions during the obstructive years promotes understanding, while aligning family decisions with favorable periods fosters cohesion.\n\n**6. Social Connections and Reputation**\nSocial standing is built over time, not by impulsive actions. The poem’s emphasis on patience ensures that reputation grows steadily and is resilient. Once the favorable season arrives, the reputation can “bloom” dramatically, reflecting the poem’s central metaphor.",
