    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於命運與修為的相互作用。首句「功名富貴自能為」指出，名利的成就並非全由偶然，而是個人修為與行動的結果。第二句「偶著仙鞭莫問伊」提醒人們，雖有天時運勢，但不可因偶然而焦慮，應以沉著處之。第三句「萬里鵬程君有分」與「吳山頂上好鑽龜」則譬喻人生道路長遠且多變，若以平和心態迎接挑戰，終將成就非凡。詩中亦以「仙鞭」象徵偶發之助，提醒人不必過度依賴外在偶然，而是應聚焦於自身修為。此詩以「吳山頂上好鑽龜」作結，譬喻雖前路艱險，但堅持與智慧可讓人達到高峰，猶如鑽石般閃耀。整體來說，詩中鼓勵人以自律與寬容之心，順其自然，才可在適時展開大業。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the interplay between destiny and cultivation. The first line, ‘Power and wealth naturally come’, indicates that fame and fortune arise from one's cultivation and action rather than mere chance. The second line, ‘Fortune may strike unexpectedly—do not question it’, reminds readers that while luck may appear, one should not fret over random occurrences but face them calmly. The final two lines, ‘The great journey of a roc is yours to share’ and ‘At the peak of Mount Wu, a tortoise can be skillfully drilled’, metaphorically describe a long, varied path that, approached with a peaceful mindset, will eventually lead to extraordinary achievements. Overall, the poem encourages disciplined, tolerant hearts to align with nature and open great enterprise when the time is right.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運命と修養の相互作用に関するものです。最初の句「功名富貴自能為」は、名声と富は偶然ではなく、個人の修養と行動の結果であることを示しています。第二の句「偶著仙鞭莫問伊」は、運が偶発して現れる場合でも、無駄に心配せず、落ち着いて対処すべきだと読者に思い知らせます。最後の二句「万里鵬程君有分」「吳山頂上好鑽龜」は、長く変化に富む人生の道を、平穏な心で迎えれば最終的に卓越した成果へと導くという比喩です。総じて、詩は自律と寛容の心で自然と調和し、適切な時期に大きな業を開くよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that true success and fortune are not the product of random chance alone but the result of diligent cultivation and mindful action. The verses encourage a balanced perspective: while one may receive unexpected aid (the ‘仙鞭’), one should not become anxious or dependent on such fortune, but rather maintain composure and focus on personal development. The imagery of the long journey of the roc and the tortoise drilled at the summit of Mount Wu suggests that a long and varied path, when approached with a calm heart, will ultimately lead to extraordinary achievements. In sum, the poem advocates for disciplined self‑improvement, tolerance, and aligning with natural rhythms to seize opportunities at the right time.\n\n**1. Health**\nThe second line advises against worrying about random misfortunes, implying that a calm mindset contributes to better physical well‑being. By focusing on cultivation rather than external circumstances, suo practitioners may reduce stress‑related ailments.\n\n**2. Career**\nThe first line indicates that career advancement (power and wealth) stems from one's own efforts and training. Thus, strategic skill‑building and perseverance are keys to professional growth.\n\n**3. Personal Development**\nThe entire poem is a metaphor for self‑cultivation: continuous learning, self‑discipline, and tolerance are emphasized as pathways to success.\n\n**4. Relationships**\nMaintaining composure in the face of unexpected events encourages harmonious interactions with others, fostering supportive social ties that can buffer against life's turbulence.\n\n**5. Wealth**\nFame and fortune are framed as natural outcomes of diligent cultivation; therefore, consistent personal improvement is the true source of financial gain.\n\n**6. Life Purpose**\nThe final two lines portray a grand journey that, when embraced with a serene mind, culminates in extraordinary accomplishments—suggesting that individuals should pursue purposeful, long‑term goals while staying aligned with the natural flow of life.",
