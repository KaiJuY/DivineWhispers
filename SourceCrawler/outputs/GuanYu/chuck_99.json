    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於一位貴人於水雲鄉相遇，雖然交往保持淡漠，但卻帶來延伸機會，最終使得主人驊騮迅速橋至康莊。詩中以「水雲鄉」象徵機會與不確定性，並以「黃閣」象徵新的起點與發展。冷淡的情感表現出相遇時的距離感，而「延故客」暗示貴人仍願舊知相邀，為主人提供昇進與順利進展之道。整體而言，詩表達初期人際關係可能遠離，但若於關鍵時刻獲得貴人之助，則能迎向成功與安泰。此籤亦暗示貴人之助不僅限於財務，更延伸至心靈與事業層面，提醒持有者善於抓住每一次的機會，方能迎向更為光明的未來。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about encountering a noble person in Shuiyun Village, and although the interaction remains distant, it brings opportunities, ultimately enabling the protagonist to ride a swift steed to prosperity. The poem uses \"Shuiyun Village\" to symbolize opportunity and uncertainty, while \"Yellow Pavilion\" represents a new starting point and development. The cold sentiment shows the distance at the time of meeting, and \"extend the old guest\" hints that the noble still invites the old acquaintance, thus offering the protagonist a path to promotion and smooth progress. Overall, the poem conveys that although initial interpersonal relations may seem distant, receiving help from a noble at a crucial moment can lead to success and ease. This divination also hints that the assistance of the noble is not limited to finances, but extends to spiritual and career aspects, reminding the holder to seize each opportunity to step toward a brighter future.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、水雲郷で貴人と出会い、交流は距離を保ちつつも機会をもたらし、結果として主人公が速い馬に乗って繁栄へと進む様子を描いている。詩では「水雲郷」が機会と不確実性を象徴し、「黄閣」が新たな出発点と発展を表す。冷たい感情は出会いの瞬間の距離感を示し、「旧客を延ばす」ことで貴人が旧知を招待し、主人公に昇進とスムーズな進展の道を提供している。全体として、初期の対人関係が遠くても、重要な時に貴人の助けを得れば成功と円滑さに導かれるというメッセージを伝えている。この占いは、貴人の援助が金銭面に留まらず、精神的・キャリア面にも広がり、持ち主にすべての機会を掴むことの重要性を示唆している。",
