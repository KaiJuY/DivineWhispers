It urges early offerings to deities to transform danger into blessing, warning that delaying prayers will lead to regret that cannot be undone. The original meaning is preserved and rendered in a clearer, consistent style.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is:\n• The contrast between a prosperous past year and a declining fortune this year.\n• A warning that favorable events are ending and adverse circumstances will soon appear.\n• A call to perform early incense offerings to deities in order to convert potential misfortune into blessing.\n• A reminder that postponing such rituals will leave one with remorse that cannot be undone.\n• The underlying philosophical idea that one should anticipate challenges and act preemptively rather than react only when calamity has already struck.",
