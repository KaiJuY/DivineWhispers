    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對比過往與目前的運勢，提醒人們即使過去曾順遂，未來亦可能遭遇不順。前兩句說明去年事事皆宜，卻與今年運氣衰弱形成鮮明對照，指出命運的無常與變遷。後兩句則給出實際建議：在遇到困境時應及時向神佛獻香，祈求轉運，避免因延誤而留下無法挽回的悔恨。整首詩以簡潔的語言勾勒出時間與行動的關係，強調主動防範與靈性修行的重要性。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a comparison between past and present fortunes, reminding that even if past was favorable, future may encounter misfortune. The first two lines describe last year everything was favorable, while this year's luck has declined, highlighting the impermanence and change of destiny. The last two lines offer practical advice: when facing difficulties, one should promptly offer incense to gods and Buddha, praying for a change of fate, and avoid regrets that cannot be undone by delay. The whole poem uses concise language to outline the relationship between time and action, emphasizing the importance of proactive prevention and spiritual practice.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、過去と現在の運勢を対比し、過去に順調でも将来は不運に見舞われる可能性があることを示唆するものです。最初の二句は昨年は万事が宜しく、今年は運気が衰えたと述べ、運命の無常と変化を強調しています。後半では、困難に直面した際には神仏に香を捧げて転運を祈るよう実践的な助言を与え、遅延によって取り返しのつかない後悔を避けるよう警告しています。全体として、時間と行動の関係を簡潔に描き、積極的な備えと精神修行の重要性を強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that past successes do not guarantee future fortune; change is inevitable, and one must act promptly to avoid regret. The verses contrast last year's favorable circumstances with this year's decline, warning that the fortunes of life can reverse swiftly. They advise that when difficulties arise, offering incense to deities and praying for a change in destiny can transform misfortune into good fortune, thereby preventing regret that cannot be corrected later. This reflects a pragmatic, spiritually oriented approach to confronting the capricious nature of fate.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem implies that even when health is stable, it can deteriorate unexpectedly. Vigilant self‑care and timely preventive measures are essential. Prompt medical attention and maintaining a balanced lifestyle prevent regrets that cannot be remedied.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nRomantic or familial bonds may shift as fortunes change. It is important to communicate openly and resolve conflicts early, rather than waiting until problems worsen, which would be irreparable.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nPrevious successes in one’s career do not assure continued progress. Regular self‑assessment and proactive skill development keep one prepared for downturns and reduce the likelihood of sudden setbacks.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial prosperity can ebb with shifting circumstances. Prudently budgeting, diversifying investments, and monitoring expenses prevent future crises that could cause irreversible losses.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily harmony can be disrupted by unforeseen misfortunes. Nurturing trust, sharing responsibilities, and seeking counsel promptly maintains unity and avoids deep‑seated resentment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nSocial standing may deteriorate if one does not act with foresight. Maintaining integrity, offering support when needed, and addressing conflicts early protect reputation and keep one from reputational damage that may be difficult to repair.",
