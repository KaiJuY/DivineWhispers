    "zh": "這首詩的主題是春夏雨水的循環與人事的耐心與延遲。詩中以「春來雨水太連綿」描寫春雨持續，隨後「入夏晴乾雨又愆」，卻缺乏降水，直到「三伏」之際才迎來甘霖。此循環暗示人生命運亦有起伏，需經過漫長的等待與忍耐，才能迎來收穫與安寧。作者用自然景象映射人生，強調不應急於求成，應順其自然，靜待時機，方能得到實質的回報。整首詩以簡潔的四句傳達，既有天象的變化，又隱含對人情世故的啟示，提醒人們在逆境中保持耐心，並相信終有好時光。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the cyclical pattern of spring and summer rainfall and the patience and delay inherent in human affairs. The poem describes continuous spring showers with “春來雨水太連綿”, followed by “入夏晴乾雨又愆”, a period of dryness, until the triple heat (the “三伏”) brings abundant rain. This cycle suggests that life, too, has ups and downs, requiring prolonged waiting and endurance before one can receive harvest and peace. The author uses natural scenery to reflect life, emphasizing that one should not rush for results, but follow nature, wait patiently, and only then will real rewards appear. The poem, concise in its four lines, conveys not only changes in the heavens but also offers insight into human affairs, reminding readers to maintain patience in adversity and trust that good times will eventually come.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、春と夏の雨水循環と人事の忍耐と遅延です。詩は「春来雨水太連綿」で春雨が続き、次に「入夏晴乾雨又愆」で乾燥期を迎え、三伏（「三伏」）で豊かな雨が降るまで続きます。この循環は、人の運命も浮き沈みがあることを示し、長い待ちと忍耐を経て初めて収穫と安寧を得られることを示します。作者は自然景観を人生に映し、急がず自然に従い、静かに機会を待つべきだと強調し、実際の報酬を得るためには忍耐が必要であると語ります。四行の簡潔な詩は、天候の変化だけでなく人間関係への示唆も含み、逆境で忍耐を保ち、良い時期がやってくると信じるように促します。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that life, like the weather, moves through cycles of abundance and scarcity, and that patience is essential to endure the dry periods until the rains return. The verses trace a clear progression: continuous spring showers, an unexpected summer drought, the arrival of the triple heat, and finally a generous rainfall that nourishes the fields. This narrative suggests that hardships may precede relief, and that one must accept the natural rhythm rather than force immediate results. Below are six areas where the poem offers guidance:\n\n1. **Health** – The delayed rains mirror health fluctuations: an illness that persists until the body finally recuperates. Patients should allow time for recovery, refrain from rushing treatments, and maintain steady care, trusting that the healing process will unfold.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – Just as spring nurtures growth but summer withholds, relationships may experience periods of closeness followed by distance. Couples are encouraged to endure temporary separations, hold trust, and allow the bond to deepen when conditions become favorable.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – A career that encounters a plateau after early success parallels the dry summer. Professionals should resist the urge to seek immediate promotion, instead focusing on skill development and strategic patience until a new opportunity (the rainfall) arrives.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Fiscal fortunes may wax and wane, much like the shifting weather. Investors are advised to avoid hasty market moves during downturns, preserve capital, and remain patient until market conditions recover.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Family dynamics can mirror the poem’s cycle, with periods of conflict and reconciliation. Parents and siblings should practice calm communication, accept temporary discord, and foster understanding until harmonious resolution emerges.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Social standing may suffer during a “dry” period of reduced influence. One should not seek immediate validation but instead maintain integrity, build relationships steadily, and let positive reputation naturally flourish once favorable circumstances arise.",
