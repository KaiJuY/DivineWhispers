    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於人應以勤勞與修身為本，順應天理而不倚賴世俗的傳承。作者以「公侯將相本無種」表明，名望並非天生，而是靠不懈努力而獲得。詩中提到「好把勤勞契上天」與「人事盡從天理見」，強調個人行為的道德與勤勉能得到上天的安排。最後一句「才高豈得困林泉」則暗示即使才華卓越，只要投身於世俗務實的工作，亦能得到成功，並非一味孤芳自賞。整體而言，詩句傳遞的訊息是：修身、勤勞、順天是成就人生的關鍵。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the idea that one should base oneself on diligence and self-cultivation, following the natural order rather than relying on worldly inheritance. The author emphasizes that fame is not innate, as stated in 'public officials and generals are not born with a lineage,' but is earned through relentless effort. The lines 'work diligently to align with the heavens' and 'human affairs will ultimately follow the natural order' highlight that personal morality and diligence attract divine arrangement. The final line 'Even those of great talent cannot remain trapped in the wilderness' implies that even exceptional talent, when engaged in practical worldly work, can achieve success, rather than simply praising oneself. Overall, the poem conveys that self-cultivation, diligence, and following the heavens are keys to achieving life.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、勤労と修身を基盤とし、世俗の継承に頼らず天の理に従うという考えである。作者は『公侯将相本無種』と示し、名誉は生まれながらにしてではなく、絶え間ない努力で得られると強調する。『好把勤勞契上天』と『人事盡從天理見』という行文は、個人の道徳と勤勉が天の配慮を呼び込むことを示す。最後の句『才高豈得困林泉』は、優れた才能でも実務に取り組めば成功を収めることができ、自己陶酔に留まらないと示唆する。全体として、詩は修身、勤勉、天に従うことが人生の鍵であると伝えている。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that personal success arises from diligent effort and moral alignment with the natural order, rather than inherited status. The verses encourage the reader to cultivate virtue, work tirelessly, and trust that divine favor will accompany persistent striving. They also imply that talent alone is insufficient; practical application of skill within society leads to genuine accomplishment. The poem serves as a reminder that recognition, wealth, or health are granted to those who consistently pursue righteousness and perseverance.\n\n1. Health: The poem emphasizes sustained diligence and moral integrity as foundations for health. By maintaining a disciplined lifestyle and a balanced mind, one attracts positive energy, thereby reducing illness and fostering overall well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: While the poem does not directly discuss romance, its focus on virtuous conduct and honest labor encourages harmonious interpersonal bonds. People who act with sincerity and respect naturally attract partners and friends who share similar values.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Success in work is portrayed as the result of unwavering effort rather than inherited privilege. By applying one’s talents diligently in the practical realm, the poem suggests that career advancement will follow as a natural consequence of perseverance.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Material prosperity is not seen as a birthright but as a reward for hard work. The line that divine arrangement follows diligent effort implies that consistent productivity and responsible financial decisions will eventually lead to financial stability.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: A family environment that values self‑cultivation and shared responsibility will foster peace. When each member upholds moral duties and works collaboratively, familial ties strengthen and conflicts diminish.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Reputation is built through consistent, righteous action. By aligning personal conduct with universal principles, one earns respect and trust from the community, ensuring a favorable social standing that endures over time.",
