    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於商貿與貪欲的警示。詩中以南方販賣珍珠、北方販賣食鹽的對照，呈現兩種生計方式在經濟上皆可帶來高額收益。多年累積後，財富不斷翻倍，顯示商業活動可為人帶來財富。然而詩的後兩句卻提醒人們，若心中只盡量追求更高的財產，甚至想要購入土地擴張，則會因貪欲而陷入無法停歇的循環。最後一句「心欲多時何日厭」強調在無限的欲望中，缺乏滿足感與停歇的時間，易使人產生焦慮與不安。整體而言，詩句透過對財富與欲望的對比，提醒人們在追求物質利益時應保持自制與知足，避免被貪念牽引而失去心靈的平靜。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a warning about commerce and greed. The lines contrast southern merchants selling pearls with northern merchants selling salt, illustrating that both business practices can yield substantial profits. Over the years, wealth multiplies, demonstrating that commercial activities can bring riches. However, the final two lines caution that if one keeps pursuing more property, even buying land to expand, the pursuit of wealth will turn into an endless cycle driven by greed. The last line, \"When desire persists for so long, when will it wear out,\" underscores the lack of satisfaction and pause in an infinite desire, potentially causing anxiety and restlessness. Overall, the poem contrasts wealth and desire, reminding readers to maintain self‑control and contentment in the pursuit of material gains, lest greed leads to a loss of inner peace.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは商売と貪欲についての警告です。南方の商人が真珠を、北方の商人が塩を売る対比により、両方の商売が大きな利益をもたらすことが示されています。数年の積み重ねで富が倍増し、商業活動が豊かさをもたらすことを示します。しかし最後の二行は、もっと土地を買って拡大しようとすると、欲望が止まらず無限の循環に陥ると警告しています。最後の行「欲望が長く続くと、いつ疲れるか」は、無限の欲望に満足感と休息の欠如があるため、心配や不安につながる可能性を示しています。全体として、詩は富と欲望を対比し、物質的利益を追求する際には自制と満足を保ち、貪欲に陥ることで内面の平穏を失わないように促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that while commercial endeavors such as selling pearls in the south or salt in the north can generate substantial wealth, an unrestrained pursuit of material expansion—particularly the acquisition of land—can lead to a perpetual cycle of greed and dissatisfaction. The final lines emphasize that when desire continues for too long without satisfaction, the individual becomes restless and anxious, losing inner peace. The poem therefore serves as a cautionary reminder to balance ambition with contentment, recognizing the limits of material gain.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem warns that unchecked ambition can cause stress and loss of well‑being. By suggesting the cessation of relentless pursuits, it implies that maintaining a balanced lifestyle preserves physical and mental health. Therefore, moderating the drive for wealth can reduce health risks associated with chronic anxiety.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe narrative of “stop seeking land” metaphorically extends to relationships, urging that over‑ambitious expectations can strain bonds. It encourages contentment within partnerships, suggesting that appreciating what one has fosters stronger, more harmonious connections. Hence, it advises to avoid greed in personal interactions.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nThe verses highlight that career success can be achieved without overextending into unwanted ventures. The admonition to halt “seeking land” indicates that focusing on core strengths yields sustainable growth. Thus, careerists should align goals with realistic resources, preventing overreach.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial prosperity is celebrated, yet the poem cautions against over‑acquisition of assets. It teaches that prudent financial decisions—refraining from excessive purchases—maintain stability. Consequently, investors should value long‑term security over short‑term expansion.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe admonition to avoid endless desire for property mirrors the need for domestic balance. Family harmony thrives when members are satisfied with their circumstances rather than pursuing more. The poem suggests that contentment within the household reduces conflict.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nPursuing wealth can harm social reputation if perceived as greed. By advocating moderation, the poem implies that a respectable public image is built on humility. Therefore, maintaining modest ambitions protects one’s standing within the community.",
