    "en": "This poem's theme is the interaction between natural calamities and human devotion. The verses explain that past harvests have been determined by heaven, beyond human control; this year the drought is more severe, leaving the fields parched. Yet the poem offers reassurance that within a fixed period of three days, sufficient rainfall will fall to save the dry lands. It illustrates that even in adversity, hope and faith persist, and by earnestly praying and practicing virtue one may earn heavenly benevolence. Overall, the lines remind people not to despair, but to hold steadfast faith and act positively, anticipating harmony between nature and human will.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、自然災害と人々の祈りとの相互作用である。詩は、過去の収穫は天の定めであり、人の力で変えられないと指摘し、今年は乾燥が激しく土壌が乾燥していると述べている。しかし詩は慰めも提供し、決まった期間の三日以内に十分な雨が降り、乾いた田畑を救うと語っている。これは逆境の中でも希望と信念が残り、誠実に祈り、善行を行うことで天の恩恵を得られることを示している。全体として、詩は人々に絶望せず、信念を守り、積極的に祈ること、自然と人間の調和を期待するよう促している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that human fortunes, particularly in agriculture, are largely shaped by celestial decree, yet there remains a window of hope for divine intervention. The verses recount that harvest successes and failures over the years have been determined by the heavens; this year’s severe drought has left fields parched, but it promises that within a fixed period of three days a sufficient rainfall will arrive to revitalize the dry land. This interplay between fate and faith underlines the importance of steadfast belief, earnest prayer, and virtuous conduct as means to seek heavenly benevolence. The poem thus serves as both a sober reminder of nature’s power and a hopeful encouragement that diligent devotion can prompt timely relief.\n\n1. **Health** – The stanza’s reassurance of rain after drought parallels the need for restorative periods in physical wellbeing. Regular rest and a balanced diet will replenish depleted resources, just as the promised precipitation replenishes barren fields. Maintaining health thus requires patience, vigilance, and a proactive stance.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – In the same way the poem urges faith during hardship, sustaining relationships demands trust and mutual support. When partners face difficulties, an unwavering belief in each other can create a safe harbor, much like the awaited rain offers sanctuary to the soil.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The message that outcomes are influenced by external forces yet can be ameliorated through effort mirrors professional progress. A steady effort coupled with timely action can turn stagnant periods into productive phases, similar to the three‑day interval before the rainfall.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Financial stability is not entirely within personal control; market forces can act like the drought. Nonetheless, prudent saving, investment, and a measured approach can ensure that, when favorable conditions arrive, resources are ready to absorb them and grow.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The communal nature of shared prayers in the poem highlights the role of collective intention. Family cohesion is strengthened when members unite in shared purpose, offering support during lean times and celebrating successes when opportunities like the rainfall come.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Public perception is subject to external events, yet consistent integrity builds lasting goodwill. By staying true to values and contributing positively, one can weather criticism and ultimately gain respect, analogous to how faithful prayers attract divine favor.",
