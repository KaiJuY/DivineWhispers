    "zh": "這首詩的主題是以心地之修養為中心，強調不妄求、順應天命，才能獲得真實福祉。前兩句以「好將心地力耕耘」與「彼此山頭總是墳」作對照，指出人若以正念辛勤耕作，將不受外在山水之境所困；「陰地不如心地好」進一步說明內在修為勝於外在環境。最後一句「修為到底卻輸君」揭示即便修為已到極致，若未與時運、天時相合，仍難得到君恩，亦提醒人應把握分寸，順從本分。詩中隱含「順天順地」之道，暗示修身、齊家、治國、平天下之大道，並呼籲持守善念、勿爭長短，方能終身受庇。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is centered on cultivating the inner heart, emphasizing that one should not seek beyond necessity and must align with destiny to receive true blessings. The first two lines juxtapose 'work diligently with your heart' and 'each other's mountaintop remains a tomb', illustrating that when a person cultivates with sincere intention, they will not be confined by external scenery; 'the negative land is not as good as a good heart' further explains that inner cultivation surpasses external circumstances. The final line, 'even when cultivation reaches its pinnacle, it still fails the ruler', reveals that even at the utmost cultivation, if it does not coincide with the timing and cosmic order, the ruler's favor cannot be attained, reminding one to keep within proper bounds and follow one's rightful duty. The poem implicitly embodies the principle of 'following heaven and earth', suggesting the path of personal cultivation, family harmony, governance, and universal peace, and urges one to maintain virtuous thoughts, avoid competing for superiority, and thus secure lifelong protection.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、心の修養を中心に据え、欲張りをしないことと天命に順応することで真の福祉を得られることを強調しています。冒頭二行では『心を耕し、力を注げ』と『互いの山頂は墓となる』を対照させ、人は正念で勤勉に耕すと外の風景に縛られず、'陰地は心地よりもよくない'とさらに内部修養が外環境を上回ると説きます。最後の一句『修為が極限に達しても君を得られない』は、究極の修養であっても、時運・天時と合わなければ君の恩恵を得られず、適切な分寸を守り本分に従うべきと警告します。詩は『順天順地』の道を含み、修身・家和・国治・天下安の大道を示唆し、善念を保ち、長短を争わずに生涯の保護を得るよう訴えます。",
    "reference": "丁公為楚項籍將。逐窘漢高祖於彭城。西兵短接。高祖急顧曰。兩賢豈相厄哉。丁公乃還。及高祖即位來謁。帝曰丁公為臣不忠。使項王失天下者也。遂斬之。曰使後為人臣無傚丁公也。喻世明言第三十一卷載。閻王殿上。丁公訴曰。某在戰場圍漢皇。皇許平分天下故放皇。稱帝後反遭殺害。漢皇以丁公背項羽故誅之。事公辯曰。紀信替皇死。卻不封贈。項伯不忠。反賜封侯。雍齒為項將。後封什方侯。漢皇無言以對。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that genuine prosperity comes from the cultivation of one's inner heart rather than from external circumstances or material pursuits. The verses contrast diligent inner work with the futility of seeking fortune through outer landscapes, stressing that a pure heart can transcend even the most adverse environments. The final admonition—that even perfected cultivation may not be rewarded if it does not align with the cosmic order—reminds the reader to act within their rightful capacity and to refrain from excessive ambition. This balanced perspective offers practical guidance across various life domains.\n建设\n1. Health\n   The poem encourages a disciplined mind that cultivates mental wellbeing, suggesting that inner peace mitigates physical illness. By tending to one's thoughts and emotions, one may prevent stress‑related ailments and foster a resilient constitution.\n2. Love and Relationships\n   Relationships flourish when both partners nurture their inner selves. The verses imply that a heart focused on virtue leads to mutual respect, reducing conflicts that arise from external pressures or unfulfilled desires.\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Ambition should be grounded in self‑improvement rather than in the chase of status or wealth. The poem warns that without aligning one's efforts with broader circumstances, even the most skilled work may not be recognized or rewarded.\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Material gains are secondary to inner cultivation. The lines advise against greed and emphasize stewardship of existing resources, implying that financial stability is a byproduct of a balanced and disciplined life.\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Within the family, a virtuous heart fosters harmony and shared purpose. The text underscores the importance of maintaining personal integrity and avoiding competition among relatives to preserve collective well‑being.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Reputation is earned through consistent, modest conduct rather than through flamboyant displays of success. The poem suggests that sustaining a virtuous temperament attracts genuine respect and safeguards one from reputation‑based disputes.",
