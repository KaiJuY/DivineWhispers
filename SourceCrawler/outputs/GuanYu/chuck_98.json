    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於經營與時機的轉折。詩中以「經營百出費精神」描寫了人為事務耗費心力，南北奔馳卻未見運勢轉變，暗示努力與成效尚未同步。第二句「玉兔交時當得意」指出，當年份屬於兔（卯）之時，命運將迎來轉機，名利得成。最後一句「恰如枯木再逢春」以枯木再逢春的比喻，形容經歷艱辛後，終將迎來繁榮盛世。整首詩透過四句短詩，提醒讀者在面對挫折時須耐心等待正確時機，並以堅持與機遇結合，最終實現事業與個人願望。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the interplay between diligent effort and the timing of fortune. The line \"Operating many affairs exhausts one’s spirit\" illustrates the toll of relentless work, while \"Traveling north and south yet luck remains unchanged\" implies that perseverance alone has not yet altered fate. The phrase \"At the Year of the Rabbit one will be triumphant\" indicates that when the year falls in the Rabbit (卯) cycle, success will manifest, and \"Like a dead tree reborn in spring\" metaphorically conveys that after hardship, a rebirth of prosperity will come.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、勤勉と運命のタイミングの相互作用である。『多くの事を経営し精神を費やす』という行は、絶え間ない努力が精神を消耗する様子を描き、『南北を奔走しても運勢は変わらない』は、粘り強さだけでは運勢が変わっていないことを示す。『玉兎の年に得意になる』は、年が卯の周期に当たる時、成功が現れることを示し、『枯れ木が春を迎えるように』という比喩は、苦難の後に繁栄が再び訪れることを象徴している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a reminder that diligent effort alone does not guarantee immediate success; timing and patience are essential to reap rewards. The verses describe a journey of exhaustion and persistent struggle, pointing out that only when the favorable cycle of the Rabbit arrives does fortune begin to shift. The imagery of a withered tree finding spring serves as a powerful metaphor for renewal after hardship, emphasizing resilience and hopeful anticipation.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem hints that persistent exertion can deplete one’s vitality, urging the reader to monitor physical well‑being and seek balance between work and rest.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The delay in favorable outcomes suggests that patience is vital in personal affairs; relationships may require time to blossom rather than forceful intervention.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – A clear message that ambition must be coupled with the right timing; relentless pursuit without strategic pauses may stall progress, but aligning actions with favorable cycles will eventually yield success.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Financial gains are portrayed as contingent on auspicious timing; prudent management during lean periods and readiness to capitalize on opportunities when they arise are advised.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The reference to a dormant state awakening in spring encourages nurturing family ties during periods of quiet, as harmony will flourish when conditions are ripe.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The narrative underscores that social standing and reputation evolve gradually; consistency and integrity over time build a foundation that will be recognized during auspicious moments.\n\nOverall, the poem advises a measured, patient approach to life's endeavors, recognizing that perseverance combined with opportune timing can transform hardship into prosperity.",
