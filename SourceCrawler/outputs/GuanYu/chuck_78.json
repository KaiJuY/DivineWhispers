    "en": "This poem's theme is a warning about family and finances. It first points out that a prosperous household and ample food are external comforts, yet if one lacks inner self‑assertion and restraint, such comfort turns into danger. Wealth, like a double‑edged sword, erodes the self when discipline and morality are missing. The verses also remind that blessings and misfortunes are self‑created, requiring thoughtful action to avoid calamities born of luxury or greed. Finally, the author calls for integrity and self‑reflection as foundations, so that family and wealth become genuine safeguards.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、家族と財務に関する警告です。詩ではまず、家道の繁栄と食料の充足は外面的な安寧であると指摘されますが、内面的な自己主張と節制が欠けると安逸は危険に変わります。財が多いことは両刃のようで、節制と道徳が不足すると自己を侵食します。詩はまた、福祉と災厄はすべて人間の行為によるもので、三度考えて慎重に行動し、一時の贅沢や貪欲が災いを招かないようにすべきと警告します。最後に、作者は正直と自己省察を基本とし、家族と財産を真の保護力に変えるよう呼びかけます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a cautionary reminder that prosperity and material abundance, while seemingly comforting, can become sources of self‑destruction if not governed by self‑awareness, discipline, and moral restraint. The verses underscore that success in family affairs and wealth accumulation does not guarantee personal security; rather, it demands continuous reflection, deliberate choice, and a vigilant guard against indulgence or greed. The poem invites the seeker to recognize that blessings and calamities are self‑generated, emphasizing the necessity of mindful conduct to convert external fortune into genuine protection.\n\n1. **Health**: The poem hints that unchecked prosperity can lead to complacency, which in turn may foster neglect of personal well‑being. By encouraging mindful moderation, it advises the individual to maintain a balanced routine, regular exercise, and healthy habits to counteract the subtle decline that accompanies idle affluence. A disciplined lifestyle safeguards both mental and physical health, ensuring longevity. Moreover, the poem subtly links indulgence to health decline, suggesting that excess often leads to stress and disease.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships ль**: In relationships, the lines caution that reliance solely on family wealth may undermine personal agency and authenticity. The poem urges cultivating self‑assertion and mutual respect within bonds, preventing the erosion of trust that can arise from material expectations. Strong, honest connections flourish when each partner maintains independence and contributes to shared values. This perspective fosters empathy, as partners recognize the importance of supporting each other's autonomy rather than imposing material expectations.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition**: Professional pursuits are warned against becoming mere pursuits of wealth; ambition without ethical restraint can backfire. The verses advocate for aligning career goals with integrity, suggesting that success is earned through conscientious effort rather than greed. By prioritizing values over monetary gain, one can build a resilient professional reputation that withstands market fluctuations. By prioritizing values over monetary gain, one can build a resilient professional reputation that withstands market fluctuations.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances**: The lines explicitly state that an abundance of riches without control breeds self‑harm. Thus, prudent financial management, frugality, and generosity are recommended. By adopting a responsible attitude toward money, one can prevent the paradoxical loss that often accompanies unchecked greed. Regular assessment of financial goals and transparent sharing with trusted advisors can further mitigate the risk of misused wealth.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony**: Family harmony is portrayed as fragile if one neglects personal growth. The poem advises nurturing individual identities within the family context, ensuring that affection is not merely transactional. Harmonious domestic life is achieved when each member recognizes their own role and responsibilities, supporting a balanced, cooperative environment. When family members respect individual boundaries, conflicts are less likely to erupt, allowing for a more harmonious domestic sphere.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation**: Social standing is threatened by indiscriminate indulgence or ostentatious displays of wealth. The verses remind the reader that reputation hinges on integrity and measured conduct. By exercising restraint and demonstrating humility, the individual cultivates lasting respect and a reputation built on trust rather than spectacle. The poem also implies that genuine social influence arises from modest contributions, not grandiose displays, reinforcing lasting connections.\n\nThus, the poem offers a holistic blueprint, urging vigilance, ethical discipline, and self‑reflection across all facets of life.",
