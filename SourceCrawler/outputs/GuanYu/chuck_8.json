    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於農業收成與時勢轉變所帶來的喜悅與安寧。首句「年來耕稼苦無收」描繪多年間辛苦耕作卻收獲甚少，顯示過去的艱辛與低谷。次句「今歲田疇定有秋」則給予轉機，表明今年天候順利，土地將迎來豐收，暗示命運即將好轉。再說「況遇太平無事日」把整體情勢置於和平、安寧的背景，說明外在環境安定有利於收穫。最後一句「士農工賈百無憂」則概括社會各階層將享有無憂的安康，寓意順遂與繁榮。整體而言，詩中傳達先苦後樂、天時地利人和相互作用的道理，提醒人們在逆境中堅持，待到良機再迎收成。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the joy and peace brought by agricultural harvests and the changing times. The opening line “Year after year, hard work yields no harvest” depicts many years of toil without gain, highlighting past hardship and low points. The next line “This year the fields will surely have autumn” offers a turning point, indicating favorable weather and a forthcoming bountiful harvest, hinting at a forthcoming turn of fortune. Then “Moreover, a peaceful, uneventful day” places the overall situation in a backdrop of peace and serenity, explaining that a stable external environment benefits the harvest. The final line “All classes—scholars, farmers, craftsmen, merchants—will enjoy worry‑free peace” summarizes that all societal strata will enjoy carefree wellbeing, implying prosperity and smoothness. Overall, the poem conveys the lesson that suffering precedes joy, and that the interplay of time, place, and people brings success; it reminds us to persevere in adversity, and when the right moment arrives, reap the rewards.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、農業の収穫と時勢の変化がもたらす喜びと平安に関するものです。冒頭の「年々耕し辛いが収穫はない」は、多年にわたる苦労が得られないことを描写し、過去の苦境と低迷を示しています。次の「今年は畑に必ず秋が訪れる」は転機を示し、今年の天候が順調で豊作が待っていることを示し、運命の好転を暗示します。さらに「さらに平和で事がない日」は、全体の状況を平和と安寧の背景に置き、安定した外部環境が収穫に有利であることを説明しています。最後の「士農工賈、百無憂」は、すべての社会階層が心配のない安らぎを享受することをまとめ、繁栄と順調さを意味します。全体として、詩は苦しみが喜びに先立つという教訓と、時間・場所・人の相互作用が成功をもたらすことを伝え、逆境で粘り強くあれば、適切な時が来れば報酬を得られると励ますものです。",
