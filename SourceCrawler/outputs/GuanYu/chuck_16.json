    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於官司纏累與和解之道。詩中先敘官事紛紛難辨，建議以休息、歸耕取代爭訟，免得因訟而荒廢田園。接著警示傍人之煽惑，提醒不應聽信外來之言，而應與親兄弟商量，藉親情之力化解爭端。整體而言，詩歌傳遞的是「與其執著於訴訟，不如以和為先，靠近身邊的人共同解決問題」的哲理。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the burden of litigation and the path of reconciliation. The verse first describes tangled official affairs that are hard to discern, suggesting that instead of engaging in disputes, one should take a break and return to farming, thereby preventing the loss of farmland due to lawsuits. It then warns against the temptations of outsiders, urging not to heed external words but to consult with close relatives, using familial bonds to resolve conflicts. Overall, the poem conveys the philosophy that 'rather than clinging to lawsuits, it is better to prioritize harmony and solve problems with those around you'.",
    "jp": "この詩の主題は、訴訟の重荷と和解への道を描いている。詩はまず、判別が難しい官事を紛糾させ、争いに巻き込まれるより休息し耕作へと戻ることを勧め、訟によって農地が荒廃するのを防ぐ。次に、外部の誘惑に警戒し、外の言葉に耳を傾けず、近しい親族と相談して親情で紛争を解決するよう促す。全体として、詩は『訴訟に固執するよりも和を優先し、周囲の人と共に問題を解決する』という哲学を伝えている。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that enduring legal disputes only bring waste and loss, while seeking harmony—especially through close family ties—offers a more constructive path. The verses emphasize stepping back from prolonged litigation, listening less to external pressure, and instead engaging in mutual understanding with those nearest to us.\n\n1. Health: The poem's advice to stop fighting legal battles reflects a broader lesson about preserving one's wellbeing. Continuous stress from litigation can erode mental and physical health; choosing calm retreat and tending to land symbolizes a return to grounding practices that nurture resilience. Thus, prioritizing rest over conflict promotes holistic health.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: By urging the seeker to consult with relatives instead of outsiders, the poem highlights the importance of trusting familiar bonds. Strong family ties provide emotional support and a neutral platform for resolving disputes, thereby strengthening relationships and fostering mutual respect.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The recommendation to abandon protracted lawsuits suggests that professional advancement should not come at the expense of personal dignity. A career built on harmony and collaboration, rather than on relentless legal confrontation, is portrayed as more sustainable and ethical.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem warns against wasting resources on costly legal battles. Investing time and money in peaceful negotiations or in returning to productive work like farming conserves wealth and prevents financial drain caused by litigation.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Central to the poem is the idea that familial counsel is superior to external counsel. By involving close relatives, one taps into shared history and trust, which can lead to more balanced and lasting resolutions, reinforcing family cohesion.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The caution against listening to outside persuasion underscores the need to protect one's reputation from manipulation. Building a reputation grounded in integrity and familial solidarity ensures long‑term respect within the community and shields against reputational harm that can arise from needless legal entanglements.",
