  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that at the age of fifty, a person’s yearning for fame may diminish, yet the tide of fortune can still arrive, and that performing good deeds is the key to securing longevity and elevated status. The poem encourages vigilance, moral cultivation, and an understanding that success may come late but is attainable with patience and virtue.\n\n1. **Health** – The final line references a long life comparable to ancient sacred tombs, implying that maintaining a compassionate and diligent heart will contribute to physical well‑being. By actively doing good, one cultivates inner harmony that promotes health.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – While the poem does not explicitly mention family, the act of “行好事” implies nurturing relationships. Compassionate conduct strengthens bonds and fosters mutual respect among partners, friends, and relatives.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The mention of “富貴逼人來” suggests that recognition will arrive even if not sought directly. By focusing on virtue rather than ambition, one can attract opportunities naturally and attain a respected position, as indicated by the “位鼎台” imagery.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Fortune is described as approaching in an almost inevitable way, but only for those who keep a good heart. Prudence, generosity, and ethical behavior become the foundations for stable financial growth.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Good deeds extend beyond oneself to the family circle. By fostering benevolence, a harmonious domestic environment is nurtured, promoting shared prosperity and mutual support.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The poem warns that while fame may fade, a good reputation endures. Consistent moral action builds a lasting reputation that elevates one’s social standing and draws positive connections.\n\nOverall, the verses present a balanced philosophy: personal growth, ethical conduct, and patient patience are the pillars for achieving a fulfilling, prosperous life at any age.",
