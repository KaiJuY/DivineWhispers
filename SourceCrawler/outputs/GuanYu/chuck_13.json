    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於時運未至、須守舊待時，方能在月亮重生之際發跡，成為萬人仰望之英雄。詩中「君今庚甲未亨通」指出當前的五年內不易見成就，宜耐心守望；「且向江頭作釣翁」象徵在河岸靜候，等待機會；「玉兔重生應發跡」寓意在卯時或月圓之時發展；「萬上頭上逞英雄」預示終將於眾人中崛起。此詩提醒人們不宜妄動，待時自會名利與身體皆得康健。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about waiting for the right time before taking action, so that when the moon is reborn, one can rise to become a hero admired by all. The line “君今庚甲未亨通” indicates that in the current five years success is unlikely, so patience is required; “且向江頭作釣翁” symbolizes patiently waiting at the riverbank, awaiting opportunity; “玉兔重生應發跡” means development should occur at the Rabbit hour or during a full moon; “萬上頭上逞英雄” predicts eventual ascension among the masses. This poem reminds people not to act rashly; when the time comes, fame, fortune and health will naturally follow.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、時が来るまで静かに待ち、月が再生したときに立ち上がり、多くの人々から称賛される英雄になることです。『君今庚甲未亨通』は、現在の五年間は成功が望めず、忍耐が必要であることを示しています。『且向江頭作釣翁』は、川岸で待ち望むことを象徴し、機会を待つ姿勢です。『玉兔重生應發跡』は、卯の時間または満月の際に発展すべきことを示します。『萬上頭上逞英雄』は、結局人々の中で上昇することを予告します。この詩は、軽率な行動を避け、時が来れば名声、富、健康が自然に得られると教えてくれます。",
    "reference": "周。姜尚。字子牙。汲人(東海許州人)。道號飛熊。先世封於呂。亦曰呂望。避紂亂居東海之濱。釣於磻溪(渭水)。其鉤為直。意不在魚。志在君相。文王聞其賢。聘為師(丞相)。(其時年八十)後周伐紂。滅商興周。武王稱曰尚父。封其子丁公於齊。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that when a favorable period has not yet arrived, one should refrain from rash actions and patiently wait, because the moment of renewal – symbolized by the reborn Jade Rabbit and the full moon – brings the opportunity for personal achievements and social recognition. The verses illustrate the necessity of timing, perseverance, and the readiness to rise when the stars align.\n\n1. Health: The line “君今庚甲未亨通” suggests a period of ill‑fortune or delayed recovery. It advises a cautious approach to health, avoiding overexertion and allowing the body time to heal. When the right moment arrives, recovery and vitality are expected.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The poem’s admonition to remain patient and not to force actions implies that relationships should develop naturally. Forced advances may backfire; waiting for the right time can lead to deeper, more harmonious connections.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: “且向江頭作釣翁” portrays a calm stance of waiting for opportunities. Career growth will come gradually, not through impulsive moves. Aligning actions with favorable timing enhances success and recognition.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The notion of “玉兔重生應發跡” indicates that financial gains are tied to auspicious cycles. One should manage resources prudently, investing when conditions are favorable, rather than seeking quick gains.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem’s message of restraint and patience can be applied to family dynamics. Avoiding hasty decisions maintains harmony, and waiting for the right moment can strengthen bonds and ensure collective well‑being.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The promise of “萬上頭上逞英雄” suggests that social standing will rise when timing is right. Cultivating a reputation of reliability and patience can lead to respect and influence within the community.",
