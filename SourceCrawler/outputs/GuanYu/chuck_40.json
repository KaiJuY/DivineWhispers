    "en": "This poem's theme is that self‑directed initiative is core; by replacing equipment to enlarge scale, it cautions against following the crowd, urges listening to messages, and after traversing rough 狗 terrain, a smooth path emerges. The poem emphasizes action, proactive and leading, and implies that managing external information well can transform difficulties into bridges to success. In this verse, 'newly replaced scale' symbolizes opportunities from innovation; 'why follow others' reminds people not to blindly follow others but seek personal direction; 'listen to the words at the ears' hints at crucial information grasp; 'through rugged paths, one sees smooth roads' shows that after trials a clear way appears, implying perseverance eventually brings success.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは自己主導の主旨であり、新しい設備を導入して規模を拡大しながら、他者の波に乗ることを避け、耳に入る情報を聴き取り、荒れた道を歩み終えてスムーズな道が開けるということです。詩は行動と先手を重視し、外部情報をうまく扱えば困難が成功への橋に変わることを暗示します。この句では、『新しく取った大きな規模』が革新による機会を象徴し、『他人の足跡を追わない理由』が盲目的な追随を避けるよう促し、『耳に入る情報を聞く』が重要な情報把握を示し、『険しい道を歩んだ後、円滑な道が見える』は試練を経た後に明確な道が現れ、粘り強さが最終的に成功へと導くことを示唆しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is an exhortation to adopt a proactive stance: by upgrading tools, scaling efforts, and remaining alert to incoming information, one can transcend obstacles and eventually discover a clear, prosperous path. The imagery of replacing old equipment and traversing rugged terrain underscores that progress requires deliberate choices rather than passive imitation, and that continuous attentiveness to surrounding signals enables the transformation of difficulties into opportunities for success.\n\n1. **Health**: Individuals may find that maintaining a disciplined regimen—mirroring the poem's call to replace old habits—leads to improved well‑being. By attentively monitoring health cues (the \"messages at the ears\"), one can preempt complications and steer toward recovery. Consistent vigilance ensures that health challenges become manageable rather than overwhelming.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships**: Romantic and social bonds benefit from a proactive approach; rather than following others' paths, partners should seek personal communication and mutual understanding. Listening to subtle signals and adjusting behavior (the \"messages to hear\") fosters trust and intimacy. Overcoming relational rough patches results in a smoother, more harmonious connection, just as the poem describes a smooth road after rugged terrain.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition**: Career advancement is likened to scaling up operations—requiring strategic innovation and a readiness to adapt. Avoiding blind following of industry trends and instead setting personal milestones can open new avenues. By staying receptive to market insights, obstacles transform into stepping stones toward professional growth.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances**: Financial prudence mirrors the poem’s emphasis on replacing inefficient methods with more effective tools. Monitoring economic signals and acting on them promptly prevents fiscal pitfalls. Persistent, informed decision‑making converts potential setbacks into investment opportunities, leading to a stable financial trajectory.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony**: Family dynamics can improve when members take initiative rather than simply mirroring each other’s behaviors. Paying attention to unspoken concerns and addressing them promptly builds cohesion. Even when family life is turbulent, maintaining proactive communication paves the way for lasting harmony.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation**: Social reputation thrives on originality and responsiveness. By adopting innovative interactions and remaining attuned to community feedback, one can avoid the stagnation that comes with imitation. Such engagement transforms social challenges into opportunities for recognition and respect.",
