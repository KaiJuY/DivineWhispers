    "zh": "這首詩的主題是以焚香祈禱作為自我檢視的方式，提醒人們在善惡的分辨上須保持公正與透明。詩中指出，善惡不外乎天道所定，唯有內心自知，方能把握自己的行為。若能屏除昧心，杜絕隱藏的心機，外在行動亦能順遂無礙。最後，作者以「出門無礙」為結語，暗示只要心正、行正，人生道路便會暢通無阻。除此之外，詩句中亦隱含對人際互動的警示，提醒不應以私心行事，否則即使外在表面光鮮，也難以得到長久的順遂。整體而言，詩以簡練的語言勾勒出一條由內而外的修行之路，強調正直與真誠是通往順利之門的關鍵。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is that burning incense and offering prayers serves as a means of self‑examination, reminding people to remain fair and transparent when discerning good and evil. The poem states that good and evil are determined by the divine order, and only by inner self‑awareness can one master one’s own actions. If one can eliminate hidden malice and prevent concealed schemes, external actions willissima proceed smoothly without obstacles. In conclusion, the author ends with “no obstacles when going out,” implying that as long as one’s heart and conduct are upright, life’s path will be clear and unobstructed. Moreover, the poem hints at a warning regarding interpersonal interactions, reminding that acting with selfish motives, even if outwardly polished, cannot achieve lasting smoothness. Overall, the poem sketches a path of inner‑to‑outer cultivation, emphasizing that integrity and sincerity are the keys to unlocking a smooth journey.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、焚香と祈祷を自己検証の手段として用い、善悪の区別において公正と透明性を保つよう人々に呼びかけることである。詩は善悪が天道により定められ、内なる自己認識がなければ行動を掌握できないと述べている。隠れた悪意を除き、隠れた策略を防げば、外部の行動も障害なく円滑に進む。結びとして「出門無礙」と締めくくり、心と行いが正しければ人生の道は明確で障害のないものになると示唆している。さらに、人間関係における警告も暗示し、私心で行動すれば外面は整っても長続きしないと警告している。全体として、詩は内面から外面へと至る修行の道を簡潔に描き、誠実さと正直さが順調な旅への鍵であると強調している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the act of burning incense and offering prayers serves not merely as a ritual but as a mirror for self‑reflection, urging individuals to maintain fairness, transparency, and integrity in all aspects of life. The verses emphasize that the distinction between good and evil is ultimately governed by the natural order; true mastery comes from recognizing one’s own moral compass. By eliminating hidden malice and covert schemes, one can ensure that outward actions proceed smoothly without obstruction. The concluding image of “no obstacles when going out” conveys that a clear mind and upright conduct pave the way for a seamless journey.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem implies that inner purity and honest conduct contribute to physical well‑being. When one’s thoughts and motives are clear, stress and anxiety diminish, which positively influences the body’s resilience. A mindful approach to daily life can prevent ailments that arise from mental tension.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe verses warn against selfish intentions that mask themselves as benevolent gestures. In relationships, genuine affection must be free from hidden motives; otherwise, harmony falters. Trust and transparency are the foundations upon which lasting affection rests.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nProfessional success is tied to integrity and fairness. The poem advises that ambition should be pursued with transparency, ensuring that no covert agendas impede progress. When one acts with honesty, workplace interactions become smooth and achievements more sustainable.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial stability depends on honest dealings. By rejecting hidden schemes and deceptive tactics, monetary gains are more likely to be long‑lasting. The poem reminds readers that wealth achieved through integrity endures, whereas ill‑earned riches dissipate.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nWithin the family, the message stresses the importance of open communication and avoiding manipulative behaviors. A household that practices fairness experiences fewer conflicts. The sense of unity is reinforced when each member’s intentions are clear and well‑meaning.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe poem highlights that reputation is earned through consistent uprightness. If one cultivates a reputation for transparency and honesty, social circles expand naturally, and obstacles fade. Conversely, a reputation built on hidden malice invites criticism and isolation.",
