    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於田園買賣之爭，提醒人們以和解為主，避免訴訟帶來雙方的損失。詩中指出，若彼此以和談、讓步的態度處理問題，將能達成圓滿結局；相反，若強求以巧取勝，雖能短暫取利，卻會為後代帶來無盡禍害。詩中還引用碧仙諺語，強調退一步，守己才能安寧。對於抽到此籤的人，若詢問訴訟，宜以和解為主；若問功名，難以如願；財運有限，應以守備為主；疾病可因善心調和；行人之路尚遠。整體而言，詩歌傳遞了「循序漸進、遵循自然法則，方能獲得長遠利益」的道理。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about disputes over farmland transactions, urging people to prioritize reconciliation and avoid the losses that litigation brings. It says that if both parties handle matters with calm discussion and concessions, a harmonious resolution will be reached; conversely, forcing a clever win may bring short‑term gain but will cause endless harm to future generations. The poem also cites the saying of Bi Xian, emphasizing that stepping back and safeguarding oneself leads to peace. For those who draw this lot, if the question concerns lawsuits, compromise should be sought; questions about fame are unlikely to be fulfilled; financial fortunes are limited, so caution and restraint are advised; illness may be alleviated by a kind heart; travel plans are still far off. Overall, the poem conveys that “progressing step by step and following natural order will bring lasting benefits.”",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、田畑の売買に関する争いで、和解を重視し訴訟による双方の損失を避けるように促すことです。詩は、双方が冷静に話し合い、譲歩を行えば調和の取れた解決が得られると述べ、逆にずる賢い手段で勝利を求めれば短期的な利益は得られるものの、将来の世代に無限の災いをもたらすと警告しています。碧仙の諺を引用し、後退し自己を守ることで平安を得ることを強調しています。この籤を引いた人は、訴訟に関しては妥協を求め、功名は実現しにくい、財運は限定的で慎重と節制が必要、病気は善意で和らげられ、旅行の計画は遠いと考えるべきです。総じて、詩は「順序立てて自然の法則に従うことで長期的な利益を得られる」という教訓を伝えています。",
    "reference": "晉。石崇字季倫。為城陰太守。伐吳有功。封安陽鄉侯。財業豊積。室宇宏麗。庖膳窮水陸之珍。與王愷以奢靡相尚。後為交趾採訪。此有美女。名綠珠。以珍珠十斛買之。藏於金谷。被趙王倫窺見。乃以計害崇。冀得綠珠。及崇被難。綠珠墜樓而死。"

It echoes the wisdom that stepping back and adhering to natural order and duty brings long‑term peace and benefit.\n\n1. Health: The poem advises maintaining a calm mind; good intentions and a peaceful disposition can alleviate illness, indicating that mental serenity supports physical well‑being.\n2. Love and Relationships: By emphasizing compromise and understanding in conflicts, it stresses that mutual respect and flexibility in partnerships foster harmony and prevent long‑term resentment.\n3. Career and Ambition: Success that relies on manipulation or force is fleeting and harmful; true career progress comes from steady, ethical effort and following the right path.\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem suggests caution in financial dealings; gains achieved through dubious means are unsustainable and may create future liabilities for oneself and heirs.\n5.
