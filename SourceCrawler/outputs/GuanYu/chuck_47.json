    "en": "This poem's theme is about staying calm and self-reflecting when facing disputes and conflicts. The poem consists of four couplets: first, “With you, a thousand words and a thousand more” admonishes that although one may speak many words, the key lies in one's attitude; next, “Only wishing peace will settle your grievances” reminds that if you remain calm, grudges will fade; the third line, “Litigation ends in disaster—remember this” directly hits the danger of legal action and urges caution; finally, “In the clear night, test your heart” encourages self‑examination at night to confront inner feelings honestly, thereby avoiding calamities. Overall, the poem emphasizes that self‑discipline and emotional regulation are essential to avert conflict and misfortune.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、争いに直面したときに冷静さと自己省察を保つことについてです。詩は四連句で構成され、まず「君と万語、千言を超えて」と言い、言葉が多くても心構えが重要であると戒めます。次に「平和を願えば恨みは消える」と、平静でいれば恨みが消えることを示しています。三行目の「訴訟は終始凶悪である—覚えておけ」は訴訟の危険を直接指摘し、慎重さを促します。最後に「清夜に心を捺めてみよ」と、夜に自分の心を問い直し、内なる感情を正直に直面することで災厄を避けるよう勧めています。総じて、この詩は自己規律と感情管理が衝突や不幸を防ぐ鍵であると強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that in situations of conflict or potential litigation, maintaining inner calm, practicing self‑reflection, and avoiding impulsive actions are essential for preventing harm and ensuring peace. The poet condenses this wisdom into four succinct lines: the first warns that excessive talk is meaningless without calm intent; the second promises that peace will erase grudges; the third cautions that legal disputes inevitably lead to ruin; the fourth urges nightly self‑scrutiny to keep conscience clear. These instructions provide a practical framework that can be applied across many aspects of life.\n\n1. Health – The poem suggests that a clear, balanced mind protects against physical and mental illness. By keeping emotions in check and avoiding stress‑inducing arguments, one reduces cortisol spikes that harm the body. Regular self‑reflection allows early detection of stress patterns, enabling timely self‑care measures such as rest, meditation, or therapy.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – In relationships, the advice to seek peace and to “reconcile the grievances” signals that open, calm dialogue can dissolve resentment. The warning that litigation ends badly discourages couples from resorting to legal action over domestic disputes, instead promoting compromise, empathy, and mutual respect.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – For professional life, the poem’s counsel against hasty lawsuits advises entrepreneurs and employees alike to resolve conflicts internally. A calm demeanor reduces workplace tension, fosters collaboration, and preserves reputational capital. The reminder to examine oneself nightly can help leaders align their actions with ethical standards, avoiding costly mistakes.\n\n4. Wealth uključ i Finances – Avoiding “greed for wealth” and “litigation” aligns with prudent financial management. The text encourages mindful spending, transparent communication with partners, and cautious investment decisions that do not involve risky legal entanglements or aggressive competition, thereby ensuring long‑term financial stability.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – The lines that urge inner peace resonate strongly with family dynamics. Maintaining calm during disagreements, listening deeply, and reconciling past wrongs strengthen familial bonds. Regular self‑check‑ins ensure that family members remain aware of their own emotional states, preventing escalation into conflict.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The poem’s emphasis on self‑control and peaceful resolution protects one’s public standing. By avoiding quarrels that could become legal battles, an individual preserves a positive reputation. Continuous self‑scrutiny helps maintain authenticity, making social interactions more genuine and trust‑based.",
