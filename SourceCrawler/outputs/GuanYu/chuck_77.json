    "zh": "這首詩的主題是「根源與慎言」，以木有根、水有源的比喻提醒人應從根本著手，避免隨波逐流、聽信他人言語。詩中提到「訟到終凶是至言」，指出口舌若不慎，往往會引發訴訟與誤會，最後導致不利結果。此處強調「自此究其原」意即在行動前先調查真實情況，勿輕信表象，從而避免因言語不當或判斷失誤而招致災禍。此舉亦提醒人們在決策前深入探究根源，以防被表面之光景所誤導。除此之外，詩句「莫隨道路人閒話」警示不要被無關緊要的評論所左右，保持清晰的思路，防止被外界的流言蜚語牽動。整體而言，詩歌以簡潔的四句，傳達了對根本原因、慎言之重要性的深刻提醒，讓人反思自身行動前的審慎思考與對外部聲音的判斷力。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is \"Root causes and cautious speech,\" using the metaphor of a tree having roots and water having sources to remind people to address issues from their foundations, avoiding following the flow and believing others' words. The poem mentions \"When litigation ends in disaster, it is because of words,\" indicating that if one is not careful with speech, it can lead to lawsuits and misunderstandings, ultimately resulting in adverse outcomes. It emphasizes \"from here investigate its origin,\" meaning before taking action, investigate the truth, not easily trust appearances, thereby avoiding disaster caused by inappropriate speech or incorrect judgment. This also reminds us to delve deeply into the root before making decisions, so as not to be misled by superficial appearances. Additionally, the line \"Do not follow the path of idle chatter\" warns against being swayed by irrelevant gossip, keeping clear thought to prevent external rumors from influencing. Overall, the poem, in four concise lines, conveys a profound reminder about the importance of root causes and cautious speech, prompting reflection on prudent thinking before action and judgment of external voices.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは「根源と慎重な言葉」です。木は根があり、水は源があるという比喩で、根本から問題に取り組み、流れに乗って他者の言葉を信じないように促しています。「訟が終わって凶となるのは言葉のせい」という詩句は、言葉を慎めなければ訴訟や誤解を招き、結局不利な結果になることを示しています。「自ずからその根源を究める」という表現は、行動に移る前に真実を調査し、表面的な印象に惑わされず、言葉や判断の不備で災いを招くことを避けるべきだと強調しています。さらに「道を歩む際に人の閒話に従わないで」という行は、関係のない噂に左右されないよう警告し、外部の風説を影響しないように明確な思考を保つことを示しています。全体として、四句の簡潔な詩は、根源と慎重な言葉の重要性について深い思いを呼び起こし、行動前の慎重な考察と外部の声の判断力について反省させるものです。",
    "reference": "漢之得天下。信功居多。初封齊王。後改封楚王。高祖後疑其反。乃偽遊雲夢。執歸京師。降封淮陰侯。信以失職。怨望羞與縫灌等為伍。會帝親征陳豨。家僅上變。呂后乃與蕭何定計。誘信入朝。竟斬信於未央宮。夷其三族。"
