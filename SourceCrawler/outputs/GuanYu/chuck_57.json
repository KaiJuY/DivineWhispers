    "zh": "這首詩的主題是個人主導與抉擇。四句以短語敘述，先說事情多端、思索長，提醒勿聽他人，須自行主張；再說一旦想出對策，當即行動，避免被諸多意見糾纏。整首詩勸人把握機會、勇於決斷，並警示外界意見不可作決策的主因。此籤意在於鼓勵自我把關，讓行動以自身判斷為依據，才能在混亂之中找到明確方向。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is personal initiative and decision-making. The four lines present brief statements: first, many complications arise and long deliberation ensues; it cautions against listening to others and urges one to assert self. Then, once a solution is conceived, act immediately, avoiding being tangled in diverse opinions. The entire poem encourages seizing opportunity, decisively choosing, and warns that external voices should not dictate. The fortune urges self‑control, making actions based on personal judgment to find clear direction amid confusion.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは個人の主導と決断である。四句は短く語り、まずは事が多く思索が長いと告げ、他人の言葉に耳を貸さず自ら主張するように促す。次に、対策を思いついたら即座に行動し、多様な意見に惑わされないよう警告する。全体として、機会を掴み勇敢に決断し、外部の意見は判断の主因としないよう助言する。此籤は自分の判断に頼り、混乱の中で明確な方向を見出すよう奨励するものだ。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a call to personal agency amid complexity. It reminds the seeker that when affairs multiply and deliberation becomes lengthy, one should not heed external counsel but assert self‑directed judgment. The moment a clear solution emerges, decisive action must follow, preventing confusion from scattered opinions. Thus, the poemculation championed self‑confidence, timely decision‑making, and disciplined focus as the means to navigate uncertainty. \n1. Health – The verse suggests that in times of confusion or worry, the individual’s own resolve is key to restoring calm. By refusing to be swayed by others’ anxieties, a person can concentrate on personal wellbeing, reducing stress that may otherwise affect physical health. Timely, self‑directed decisions foster a proactive approach to health maintenance.\n2. Love and Relationships – The guidance discourages reliance on external opinions about relational matters. Instead, it encourages partners to trust their own insights, leading to clearer communication and stronger bonds. When each party acts on personal conviction, misunderstandings are less likely to proliferate.\n3. Career and Ambition – The poem’s emphasis on swift, independent action translates to professional contexts. When challenges arise, taking ownership and implementing solutions promptly can avert stagnation. By trusting one’s judgment, employees or entrepreneurs avoid paralysis caused by conflicting advice.\n4. Wealth and Finances – Financial decisions should stem from personal analysis rather than speculation or peer pressure. The stanza’s insistence on self‑determination means investors and managers should base actions on objective assessment, thereby mitigating risk associated with market uncertainty.\n5. Family and Harmony – The message promotes self‑reliance in familial dynamics, suggesting that members should resolve matters through personal deliberation rather than external mediation. This approach encourages responsibility, preventing the spread of discord caused by others’ interference.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The poem warns against letting the opinions of friends or the public dictate personal choices. By maintaining an internal compass, individuals safeguard their integrity and reputation. A clear, confident stance also reinforces social respect and trust.",
