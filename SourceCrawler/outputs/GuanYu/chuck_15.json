    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於婚姻與時機的選擇。詩中先指出兩家門戶各相當，暗示目前兩方面條件相近，但若缺乏感情契合，婚姻並非最佳選擇。接著以「直待春風好消息」說明應耐心等待，等到春風般的吉時，方能順利結合。最後一句「卻調琴瑟向蘭房」則是提醒在適時之際，可像琴瑟般調和雙方，達成和諧相處。整體而言，詩歌倡導以謹慎審時、以感情為重、以和諧為基礎的婚姻觀，否則易招焦慮與失敗。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the choice of marriage and timing. The verse first points out that the two households are equally matched, implying that while the conditions are similar, without emotional compatibility, a marriage is not ideal. Next, the line 'wait for the spring breeze of good news' indicates that one should patiently await a favorable season, when the spring wind brings good fortune, allowing the union to proceed smoothly. The final line 'yet adjust the zither toward the orchid room' reminds that at the appropriate time, like a zither, both parties can harmonize to achieve harmony. Overall, the poem advocates a marriage view that prioritizes cautious judgment of timing, emotional depth, and harmonious foundation; otherwise, it will lead to anxiety and failure.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは結婚とタイミングの選択に関するものです。詩はまず両家が同等であることを指摘し、条件は似ているが感情の相性がなければ結婚は最適ではないと示唆します。次に「春風の良い知らせを待て」と語り、好ましい季節を辛抱強く待ち、春風が幸運をもたらす時に結びつきが円滑に進むよう示します。最後の「琴を蘭の部屋へ調える」は、適切な時に琴のように両者が調和し、和を成すことを思い出させます。総じて、詩はタイミングの慎重な判断、感情の重視、和の基盤を優先する結婚観を提唱し、そうでないと不安と失敗に繋がると語っています.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that marriage should be approached with careful timing and emotional readiness; premature unions may lead to dissatisfaction, while patience during the right season can bring harmony and fulfillment.\n\n1. Health: The poem’s emphasis on waiting for a favorable “spring wind” metaphorically suggests that one should allow time for physical and mental health to stabilize before committing to major life changes. Sudden decisions can stress the body and exacerbate existing ailments. Thus, cultivating a healthy lifestyle and monitoring wellbeing is advised before pursuing marriage.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The verse explicitly warns against coupling based solely on social status, urging that affection and mutual understanding form the foundation of a successful partnership. When both partners share genuine feelings, the union can thrive like a well‑tuned instrument. Conversely, a relationship built on external appearances is likely to falter.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: A prudent approach to career matters is implied by the need to “wait for spring.” Prioritizing professional development and ensuring stability will provide the necessary confidence to enter a marriage. Rapid career advancement, without reflection, may jeopardize long‑term plans.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem discourages hasty financial commitments that could accompany an ill‑timed marriage. Sound budgeting, savings, and a clear understanding of each partner’s economic status are essential. Only after a period of financial harmony should couples consider pooling resources.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The final line about “adjusting the zither toward the orchid room” highlights the importance of aligning family dynamics. Mutual respect and coordinated efforts create a domestic atmosphere akin to harmonious music. Disharmony within the household can echo discord in the marital relationship.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: By cautioning against premature alliances, the poem also advises maintaining a good reputation and reliable social networks. Reputation can influence support systems during challenges; a respected standing often brings encouragement and guidance. Engaging with a supportive community helps both partners navigate the responsibilities of marriage.",
