    "zh": "這首詩的主題是戰爭與人心的複雜性以及勝利後的衰老與重逢。首句以百千人面虎狼心為喻，形容周圍勢力多變，心機重重。第二句說賴汝干戈用力深，暗示自己需以堅定的戰略與實力去對抗。第三句「得勝回時秋漸老」則揭示戰勝後的時間流逝，秋天象徵年華已逝，失去青春與活力。最後一句「虎頭城裏喜相尋」則以「虎頭」指代寅年之地，暗示在那裡會有喜悅的重逢或相遇。整首詩以戰爭為背景，透過心機與時間的交織，表達了「戰勝不等於永續，時間才是最終的勝負者」的哲理。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the complexity of human hearts in war and the subsequent aging and reunion after victory. The first line, 百千人面虎狼心, metaphorically describes the many shifting forces around, each with a cunning heart. The second line, 賴汝干戈用力深, implies that one must confront with firm strategy and strength. The third line, 得勝回時秋漸老, reveals the passage of time after victory, with autumn symbolizing the loss of youth and vigor. The final line, 虎頭城裏喜相尋, uses \"虎頭\" to refer to the land of the Tiger, implying a joyful reunion or encounter there. The poem sets war as its backdrop and, through the intertwining of scheming hearts and time, conveys the philosophy that \"victory does not equal everlasting success; time is the ultimate judge.\"",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは戦争と人心の複雑さ、勝利後の老いと再会についてです。最初の行、百千人面虎狼心は、多くの変わりやすい力を巧妙な心で描写しています。第二行、賴汝干戈用力深は、確固たる戦略と力で対峙する必要があることを示しています。第三行、得勝回時秋漸老は、勝利後の時間の流れを明らかにし、秋は若さと活力の喪失を象徴しています。最後の行、虎頭城裏喜相尋は、\"虎頭\"を寅年の土地に置き換え、そこで喜びの再会や出会いがあることを示唆しています。詩は戦争を背景にし、策略と時間が交錯することで、\"勝利は永遠の成功を意味しない。時間こそが究極の審判者だ\"という哲学を伝えています。",
    "reference": "韓信率諸侯兵。與楚王大戰於九里山。十面埋伏。圍籍垓下。籍走至烏江。有高長犧舟以待曰。今獨臣有船。王急渡江東。亦足王也。籍笑曰。江東子弟仝籍。渡江西誅秦無道。今無一人還。縱江東父兄。憐而王我。我獨不愧於心乎。竟自羽(刎)而死。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that in the midst of a complex battlefield with cunning enemies, one must rely on steadfast strength and strategy. Victory brings a sense of completion, yet the passing of time—symbolized by autumn—reminds us that triumph is fleeting. The final line hints at a hopeful reunion in a place associated with the Tiger (寅), suggesting that even after hardship, there can be joyful encounters. \n\n1. Health: The poem warns against complacency after success. Just as the autumn wind chills, one must remain vigilant against unforeseen ailments or fatigue. Regular self‑care and mindful rest will help sustain long‑term well‑being.\n2. Love and Relationships: The metaphor of “cunning hearts” implies the need for trust and transparency. A strong partnership thrives when both partners commit to clear communication, preventing misinterpretation that could lead to conflict.\n3. Career and Ambition: The line “賴汝干戈用力深” encourages persistent effort. Ambitious individuals should deepen their skill set and remain resilient in competitive environments, knowing that early victories may not guarantee lasting status.\n4. Wealth and Finances: While the poem speaks of triumph, it also cautions that prosperity can erode over time. Sound financial planning, diversification, and cautious spending are essential to protect gains during the “autumn of aging.”\n5. Family and Harmony: The mention of a reunion in the Tiger‑headed city suggests that familial bonds can be rekindled after periods of strain. Maintaining open dialogue and shared values can rebuild harmony once obstacles are overcome.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Success is public, but the poem reminds us that reputation can change as circumstances shift. Continuous self‑improvement and genuine generosity help sustain a positive social standing, even as the seasons of life change.",
