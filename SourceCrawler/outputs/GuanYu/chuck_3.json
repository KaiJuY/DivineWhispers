    "en": "This poem's theme is a reminder of destiny and a pragmatic attitude. The opening line \"衣食自然生處有\" indicates that as long as people act according to their natural duties, basic needs will be met, and there is no need to strive for extravagance. The second line \"勸君不用苦勞心\" cautions against excessive labor and worry, as relentless pursuit often brings self‑imposed hardship. The final two lines \"但能孝梯存忠信，福祿來成禍不侵\" point out that maintaining filial piety at home and loyalty in dealings will bring fortune while averting calamity. Overall, the poem encourages following the natural course, maintaining the status quo and acting prudently, thereby achieving peace through internal and external harmony.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運命と実利主義への警告です。冒頭句「衣食自然生處有」は、凡人が自分の本分に従えば生活は自ずと安泰であり、贅沢を強要する必要はないと示しています。第二句「勸君不用苦勞心」は、過度の労働と心配を避けるように警告し、過剰な追求は自らを苦しめると述べています。残りの二句「但能孝梯存忠信、福祿來成禍不侵」は、家庭で孝道を守り、他人に対して忠実であれば、福徳が訪れ、災厄を回避できると指摘しています。全体として、詩は自然に従い、既存の状態を維持し慎重に行動することで、内外の調和の中に平安を得られると勧めています。",
