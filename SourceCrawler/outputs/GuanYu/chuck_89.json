    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於時間與命運的相互交織，暗示當下雖無明顯進展，但以輕鬆的姿態等待，終將迎來機會。首句樽前無事且高歌，表示目前處於安定無事、可暫時放鬆心情的階段。時未來時奈若何，提醒須保持耐心，等待時機到來。白馬渡江嘶日暮，象徵白馬之勢在日落時分橫渡江面，意即在時機成熟時，才會展現力量與成就。虎頭城裏看巍峨，描繪城中威勢高峻，寓示最終成就將如巍峨山峰般壯觀。整體而言，詩歌以景象象徵方式，預示先有等待，後有大成的順序。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the intertwining of time and destiny, suggesting that although no obvious progress is present now, by maintaining a relaxed attitude while waiting, opportunities will eventually arise. The opening line '樽前無事且高歌' conveys that currently one is in a calm, untroubled state and can temporarily relax. The line '時未來時奈若何' reminds one to remain patient and await the arrival of the right moment. '白馬渡江嘶日暮' symbolizes a white horse crossing the river as dusk falls, implying that when the timing is ripe, strength and achievement will emerge. Finally, '虎頭城裏看巍峨' depicts the majestic stature of the city, indicating that the ultimate success will be as towering as a mountain. Overall, the poem uses symbolic imagery to foreshadow a sequence of waiting followed by great accomplishment.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、時間と運命が交錯し、現在は明確な進展がなくとも、リラックスした姿勢で待つことで機会が訪れるという示唆を含む。最初の行『樽前無事且高歌』は、現在は落ち着いて無事であり、少しは気楽に過ごせる段階であることを示す。『時未來時奈若何』は、適切なタイミングが来るまで忍耐を保ち続けるべきであると注意を促す。『白馬渡江嘶日暮』は、夕暮れに白馬が川を渡る様子を象徴し、タイミングが整ったときに力と実績が現れることを意味する。最後に『虎頭城裏看巍峨』は、城の壮麗さを描き、最終的な成功が山のように壮大であることを示唆している。全体として、詩は象徴的なイメージを用いて待つことと大成の順序を予告する。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the present moment, though calm and lacking clear advancement, should be approached with patience and a relaxed spirit. The verses describe a state of temporary tranquility, a call to endure until the opportune moment, and then a promise of significant achievement onceowie timing aligns. The imagery of the white horse crossing at dusk and the majestic city of Tiger Head illustrates the eventual rise to prominence that follows a period of quiet preparation. This sequence of waiting and eventual success serves as a reminder that timing is essential and that the rewards of perseverance manifest only when conditions are ripe. 1. Health\nThe poem’s depiction of \"樽前無事\" (no disturbance at the table) implies a state of physical well‑being and calm. However, the later line about \"白馬渡江\" indicates the necessity of maintaining endurance to face future challenges. Therefore, focus on gradual, steady improvements in fitness and stress management rather than drastic changes.\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe call to \"高歌\" (sing cheerfully) suggests enjoying present moments with partners. The waiting implied in \"時未來\" advises not to rush commitments; instead, nurture relationships patiently until the right timing arrives, ensuring lasting harmony.\n3. Career and Ambition\nThe image of a white horse crossing at dusk signals a delayed but inevitable breakthrough. This implies that career progress may come later; persistence and patience are essential. Seek opportunities that align with your strengths and wait for the proper moment to make bold moves.\n4. Wealth and Finances\n\"樽前無事\" hints at a stable financial base, while \"日暮\" signals that major gains will materialize later. Avoid impulsive spending; instead, invest prudently and build reserves so that when the \"白馬\" moment arrives, you can capitalize on it fully.\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe verses encourage enjoying present peace yet anticipating future growth. In family life, prioritize harmony now while planning for future responsibilities. Avoid hasty decisions; give space for everyone’s development.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe \"虎頭城裏看巍峨\" line portrays a majestic reputation. This suggests that your social influence will rise once the timing aligns. Maintain integrity and patience; when the moment arrives, your reputation will stand tall and respected.",
