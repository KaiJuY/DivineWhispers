    "zh": "這首詩的主題是人生與世事的無常與流轉。詩中以「一生心事向誰論」揭示個人心事難尋知音，「十八灘頭說與君」象徵經歷與遇見，暗示世間難得交集；「世事盡從流水去」將世態比作流水，強調無法停留與掌控；「功名富貴等浮雲」則把名利視為雲霧，飄渺不定，提醒人須知取捨。整體而言，詩意在於以淡泊之心面對變遷，保持寬容與遠離名利，並以心靈安寧作為最終答案。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the transience and flow of life and worldly affairs. The poem opens with \"一生心事向誰論,\" revealing how one struggles to find a confidant for lifelong concerns. The line \"十八灘頭說與君\" symbolizes experiences and encounters, hinting at the rarity of meaningful interactions. \"世事盡從流水去\" likens worldly matters to flowing water, emphasizing the impossibility of holding on or controlling them. Finally, \"功名富貴等浮雲\" treats fame and wealth as drifting clouds, fleeting and uncertain, urging the reader to discern and accept, while the overall message encourages a calm heart toward change, detachment from fame, and inner peace as the ultimate resolution.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは人生と世事の無常と流れです。詩は「一生心事向誰論」と始まり、一生の心配を誰に託すかの難しさを示します。「十八灘頭說與君」は経験と出会いを象徴し、有意義な交流が希少であることを示唆します。「世事盡從流水去」は世間の事を流れに例え、手に取ることやコントロールすることが不可能であると強調します。そして「功名富貴等浮雲」は名誉や富を漂う雲に例え、儚く不確定であると示し、悟りと受容を促します。全体として、詩は変化に対し淡泊な心を保ち、名誉から離れ、内なる平安を究極の答えとするよう促します。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that life and worldly affairs are ever‑changing and transient; nothing—including fame, wealth, or personal ambitions—can be permanently held. લોકો, the verses invite a perspective of detachment, urging the individual to accept the flow of events and to find peace in inner calm rather than external success.\n\n1. Health: The poem encourages resilience in the face of bodily or mental ailments, suggesting that one should let health issues pass like water. A balanced, mindful attitude can mitigate the emotional toll of illness, while acceptance prevents unnecessary anxiety.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: Finding a trusted companion to share lifelong concerns is portrayed as rare; therefore, cultivating empathy and listening skills becomes vital. Love is not about control but about mutual acceptance within the ebb and flow of human connection.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Professional aspirations are compared to fleeting clouds, implying that over‑fixation on titles or accolades can be unfulfilling. Success should be measured by personal growth and contribution rather than external validation.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Financial gains are similarly transient; the poem advises prudent management and the avoidance of greed. A modest lifestyle aligned with one’s values fosters long‑term stability.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Familial bonds should be approached with patience and understanding, recognizing that circumstances constantly shift. Harmonious relationships are cultivated by forgiving differences and embracing change.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Social standing is fleeting; therefore, one must prioritize genuine integrity over reputation. By behaving with consistency and sincerity, one builds lasting respect that transcends transient fame.",
