    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對人世間勞心勞力的無奈與自我調適。前兩句揭示不斷勞動所換來的病痛與爭執，隨後一句把「事到頭來渾似夢」作為對世事無常的感慨，最後一句則提醒人們不必奪取過度的心機，保持安分。詩以簡練的語言描繪了在名利與健康之間的掙扎，並提出以寧靜為基調，避免無謂的爭端。它警示人們，若不斷逼迫自己，終將身心俱疲，最終難以抵擋外界的不安。相反，學會放下執著，才能獲得內心的安寧與真正的福祉。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the helplessness and self‑adjustment of people constantly laboring in life. The first two lines reveal that continual toil yields illness and quarrels; the next line treats 'in the end everything seems like a dream' as a reflection on life's impermanence, and the last line reminds readers not to exert excessive effort but to remain content. The poem uses concise language to portray the struggle between fame and health, proposing that tranquility should be the foundation to avoid needless conflicts. It warns that relentless self‑pressuring will exhaust body and mind, making it hard to withstand external unrest. Conversely, learning to let go of attachment brings inner peace and true well‑being.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人世間における心身の労苦と自己調整の無策さを描いたものです。最初の二行は、絶え間ない労働が病気や争いを生むことを示し、次の行では『終わる頃、事は夢のよう』と人生の無常を語り、最後の行では過度の努力を避け、静観することを勧めています。詩は簡潔な言葉で名声と健康の間の葛藤を描き、平静を基調とし、無意味な争いを避けるべきと提案しています。無理に自己を押し進めれば身体と心が消耗し、外部の不安に耐えられなくなると警告しています。対照的に、執着を手放すことで内なる平和と真の幸福を得られると述べています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a sober reminder that relentless pursuit of worldly goals can lead to physical illness, conflict, and eventual disillusionment, and that a more serene and contented stance is preferable. The verses capture the cyclical nature of labor, the fleeting quality of achievements, and the futility of over‑exertion, urging the reader to temper ambition with acceptance.\n\n1. **Health** – The opening couplet explicitly ties endless toil to disease. It warns that a life dominated by anxiety and constant activity can compromise bodily integrity. Maintaining mental calm and allowing rest is implied as the antidote to such health hazards.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – Though not directly mentioned, the poem’s theme of quarrels and “争執” suggests that relational tensions arise from the same over‑.Should pursue a mindset. It advises that loving bonds thrive when individuals do not force themselves into competition or relentless pursuit of status.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The line “事到頭來渾似夢” reflects the idea that career successes can feel illusory once the effort ends. It encourages a realistic appraisal of professional aspirations, cautioning against the trap of chasing titles at the cost of personal well‑being.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Implicitly, the poem cautions that financial gains achieved through over‑exertion may be fleeting or accompanied by disputes. A balanced approach to money, prioritizing stability over aggressive accumulation, is implied.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – By advocating an “安分守己” attitude, the poem hints that a stable domestic environment is best served by avoiding needless conflict. Harmonious family life is best maintained when each member respects personal limits.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The warning against “口舌” and unnecessary disputes suggests that reputation can be damaged by over‑assertiveness. Cultivating humility and restraint preserves one’s standing within the community.\n\nIn sum, the poem urges readers to recognize the limits of relentless labor, to find equilibrium between effort and rest, and to prioritize inner peace over external acclaim. This balanced perspective is likely to yield a healthier, more fulfilling life.",
