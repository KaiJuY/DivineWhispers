    "reference": "宋史。仁宗。李娠妃所生。劉后抱養為己子。左右皆為畏后威。無敢言者。故帝不如也。及娠妃卒。后欲以婢禮葬之。宰相呂夷簡請厚葬。后怒曰。一宮人死。相公何 云云。欲離閒吾母子耶。夷簡對曰。太后不以劉氏念。臣不敢言。尚念劉氏。則禮宜從厚焉。后悟乃以一品禮。夷簡再請。以后服殮。水銀實棺。太后許之。迨后崩。有為帝言娠妃所生。及妃薄殮之事。帝號慟。即往祭。易梓官親啟視之。妃以水銀實棺。面色如生。冠服悉如皇后。帝歎曰。人言其可信哉。待劉氏加厚。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that by actively cultivating relationships with wise, noble individuals, one can secure future patronage and rise in status. The verses emphasize the virtue of engaging sincerely with those of higher moral caliber, suggesting that mutual respect and dialogue create opportunities for advancement. The final line, \"he will stand shoulder to shoulder with a king and lord,\" symbolizes the attainment of honor and recognition that follows from such alliances. Thus, the poem advocates proactive networking and the cultivation of mutual respect as keys to success.\n\n1.

A supportive network can also lead to healthier lifestyle choices, as companions often share good habits and motivate one another.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nBy valuing wise companionship, the verses imply that genuine affection grows from shared values and mutual respect. Romantic partners who appreciate each other’s integrity are more likely to sustain long‑term harmony.\n\n3.

Ambitious individuals should therefore prioritize mentorship, seek guidance, and remain open to collaboration.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial prosperity is hinted at through the notion of patronage and reward. A reputation built on integrity attracts investment, sponsorship, and favorable business dealings, leading to material gains.\n\n5.
