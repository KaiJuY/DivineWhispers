    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於蘇秦以三寸舌頭為象徵，說明口才與自身修養結合，能夠獲得富貴與功名。首句「蘇秦三寸足平生」把三寸舌頭比作生命之基，暗示以言語為根本。第二句「富貴功名在此行」指出只要以此根基行事，便可得到名利。第三句「更好修為陰騭事」則提醒在取得成就之餘，更須積善積德，修為陰騭為人之德。最後一句「前程萬里自通亨」描繪了經過內在提升後，未來道路將更加寬廣、順利。詩歌整體傳達的是「以口才與修養相輔相成，成就事業同時亦需積善修德，才能走向光明長遠之路」的訊息。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is that Su Qin's three-inch tongue symbolizes eloquence, and that combining speech skill with personal cultivation brings wealth and fame. The first line 'Su Qin's three inches of tongue represent his life' likens the tongue to the foundation of existence, implying that speech is the root. The second line 'Wealth and fame lie in this journey' indicates that by acting upon this foundation, one can attain renown. The third line 'Further cultivation of hidden virtue' reminds that after achieving success one must also accumulate good deeds and cultivate inner virtue as moral conduct. The final line 'The future is wide and open' portrays that after internal improvement, the path ahead will be broader and smoother. The poem as a whole conveys the message that eloquence and cultivation complement each other, and that achieving career while accumulating virtue leads to a bright, long-term future.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、蘇秦が三寸舌を象徴として用い、口才と自身の修養を結び付けることで富と名誉を得ることができるということです。最初の句『蘇秦三寸足平生』は三寸舌を人生の基盤に例え、言葉が根本であることを示唆しています。第二の句『富貴功名在此行』は、この基盤に沿って行動すれば名誉と富を得られると示しています。第三の句『更好修為陰騭事』は、成果を得た後も善行を積み、陰の徳を修養する必要があると警告しています。最後の句『前程萬里自通亨』は、内面を高めた後に未来の道がより広く、円滑になることを描いています。詩全体としては、口才と修養が互いに補完し合い、事業を成し遂げると同時に善行と修養を積むことで、明るく遠い未来へと導かれるというメッセージを伝えています。",
    "reference": "戰國。蘇秦既說秦不行。乃歸家發憤苦讀。研究太公陰符。學成即指秦往說趙王。以合從拒秦。起王大悅。為治裝并說齊楚魏。趙王乃秦。竟佩六國相印。使秦兵十五年不敢出函谷關。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the combination of eloquence and inner cultivation can lead to success, but that success alone is insufficient; one must also accumulate virtue to sustain a truly prosperous future. The text draws a clear causal chain: the speaker’s speech (the three-inch tongue) is the foundation of life; when used wisely, it brings wealth and fame; yet the poet warns that the real reward comes from further cultivation of hidden virtue, which opens the path for a long and smooth future. This narrative underscores the importance of balancing external talent with internal moral growth. \n\n1. Health: The poem implies that nurturing one’s inner virtues (inner health) creates a solid foundation, much like a healthy body supports daily function. A clear mind and moral integrity help maintain physical and mental well‑being, which in turn supports overall health. \n\n2. Love and Relationships: The speaker’s eloquence can attract others, but genuine relationships require cultivation of inner virtues. The poem advises that beyond charming words, one must practice kindness, honesty, and empathy to sustain lasting bonds. \n\n3. Career and Ambition: Talent and eloquence are described as keys to wealth and fame. Success depends on how one applies those skills in a principled way. By developing deeper values, one achieves not only short‑term gains but a solid long‑term career trajectory. \n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem suggests that external wealth is a byproduct of a well‑grounded foundation. A prudent mindset and ethical behavior ensure that financial prosperity is stable and respected, preventing the pitfalls of greed. \n\n5. Family and Harmony: The cultivation of hidden virtue is likened to a quiet, nurturing force that strengthens the home. By integrating moral principles, one promotes harmony, respect, and support within the family unit, creating an environment that nurtures all members. \n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Eloquence may win admiration, yet the poem stresses that reputation depends on sustained virtue. Authentic social influence is built through consistent kindness and integrity, which in turn attracts supportive allies and preserves one’s standing within society.",
