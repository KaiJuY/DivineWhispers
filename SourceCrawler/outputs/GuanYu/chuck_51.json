    "zh": "這首詩的主題是『順其自然、迎接新運』。詩中先說『君今百事且隨緣』，意即此刻所有事務應隨機遇而行，放下強求，讓自然而成。接著『水到渠成聽自然』以水渠為比喻，暗示順勢而為便會自動達成目標。下句『莫嘆年來不如意』提醒不要對過去的不順念苦，因人生起伏皆是過渡。最後一句『喜逢新運稱心田』則勉勵把握眼前的新機遇，將心安於順遂之中。整體傳達的是『順應天時，心存寬容，迎來轉機』的積極訊息。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is 'Let nature flow and welcome new fortune'. The first line says, 'You now have many affairs and should follow fate', which means that at this moment all matters should be handled according to circumstance, abandoning forceful striving so that the natural order takes over. The next line, 'Water will find a channel and succeed naturally', uses the image of water finding its way to illustrate that following the flow will automatically achieve goals. The following line, 'Do not lament the past year's misfortunes', reminds us not to dwell on past difficulties, for life's ups and downs are merely transitions. The final line, 'Delight in the new fortunes that fit your heart', urges you to seize the present opportunities and find peace in the smoothness of progress. Overall it conveys a positive message of 'go with the times, keep an open heart, and embrace the turning point'.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは『自然に任せ、新しい運勢を迎える』です。最初の行では『君今百事且隨緣』とあり、現在の多くの事を運命に従い、強引に求めるのをやめて自然の流れに任せるべきだという意味です。次の行の『水到渠成聽自然』は、水が道を見つけて成るように、流れに沿えば自ずと目標が達成されることを示しています。その次の行『莫嘆年來不如意』は、過去の不運に嘆くのではなく、人生の起伏は移り変わりであるとさせます。最後の行『喜逢新運稱心田』は、今現在の新しいチャンスを楽しみ、心を満足させることを勧めています。全体として『時勢に合わせ、心を広く持ち、転機を迎える』という積極的なメッセージを伝えています。",
    "reference": "唐朝。宣宗宮內。韓夫人不蒙寵辛。偶向紅葉題詩一首。流出御溝。一應試官人。顧況(于佑)於御溝邊。拾得紅葉。上題詩云。流水何太急。深宮盡日閒。殷勤謝紅葉。好去到人間。況亦拾紅葉。戲和之云。愁見鶯啼柳絮飛。上陽宮女斷腸時。君恩不禁東流水。葉上題詩寄與誰。也從御溝中流將進去。天子知此事。卻把韓夫人嫁與于佑。夫婦百年偕老。(按御題葉名有田。姑錄其一)。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that when one relinquishes resistance and follows the natural course of events, the universe will align itself to bring about success. The imagery of water finding its channel emphasizes that with patience and alignment to circumstances, outcomes become inevitable, while the admonition against lamenting past misfortunes reminds the reader that life’s fluctuations are temporary. Finally, the encouragement to celebrate new opportunities reflects a forward‑looking optimism that change can bring fulfillment.\n\n1. Health: The line about water flowing smoothly can be interpreted as a reminder that maintaining a steady rhythm—whether through balanced diet, regular exercise, or adequate rest—helps the body reach its natural equilibrium. By not overreacting to minor ailments and trusting the body’s healing mechanisms, one can experience gradual recovery.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The poem suggests surrendering to the flow of connections. Rather than forcing outcomes, allowing interactions to develop organically fosters deeper trust and mutual understanding. Celebrating new unions encourages appreciation for fresh bonds that resonate with one’s true self.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Following the path that 'water will find a channel' implies that strategic alignment with one’s environment and patience can yield promotions or breakthroughs. Avoiding frustration over setbacks leads to clearer focus and sustained progress toward professional goals.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The idea that fortune comes naturally when the right conditions are met encourages prudent financial planning—investing wisely and saving consistently—so that when opportunities arise, one is prepared to benefit. It also warns against panic selling or hasty spending.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Accepting the ebb and flow of family dynamics, and not lamenting past conflicts, promotes a harmonious household. Embracing new harmonious arrangements reinforces respect and cooperation, creating a stable family atmosphere.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: By letting relationships flow without forced attempts, one can build authentic networks that support personal growth. Recognizing and appreciatingاور new positive social engagements helps maintain a reputation built on genuine interactions.",
