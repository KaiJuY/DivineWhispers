    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於時序與善偶的相互作用。開頭的「營為期望在春前」描寫了作者對春天的蓬勃期許，象徵新事業的開始與希望。隨後「誰料秋來又不然」揭示了時間流轉帶來的失望與挫折，提示事物並非一帆風順。接著「直遇清江貴公子」則是轉折，暗示在關鍵時刻遇到貴人相助，能改變原本不利的局面。最後「一生活計始安全」總結了結果：在貴人扶持下，生活得以安定，事業順利。整體而言，詩歌強調順時而行，善偶能成大事，且須謹慎把握機會，方能實現長遠的安寧與成功。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the rhythm of life is dictated by the seasons of opportunity and challenge; while initial enthusiasm can be tempered by unforeseen setbacks, a timely encounter with a benevolent figure can redirect the course towards stability and prosperity. The poem teaches that patience, adaptability, and the readiness to embrace unforeseen help are essential for enduring success.\n\n1. Health\n   The lines hint that health, like seasons, can fluctuate. While early enthusiasm may mask underlying ailments, unexpected downturns in later seasons warn of latent issues. Hencewasser, regular monitoring and openness to external medical advice become vital, mirroring the poem’s call to seek aid when circumstances change.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The poem’s shift from hopeful spring to autumn disappointment parallels the ebb and flow of intimate bonds. Initial affection may falter, but meeting a compassionate partner—or benefactor—can restore harmony. Relationships thrive when one is receptive to support and willing to adjust expectations accordingly.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Career endeavors begin with bright prospects but can be derailed by unforeseen obstacles. The narrative suggests that strategic collaboration and guidance from seasoned mentors are crucial. Aspiring professionals should therefore cultivate networks that can offer timely counsel, ensuring sustained progress.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Financial aspirations may appear secure at first, yet market conditions can reverse fortunes, mirroring the autumnal setback. A fortuitous financial partnership can counterbalance these losses. Managing money prudently, while remaining open to wise investment advice, aligns with the poem’s lesson on prudent timing.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Family dynamics, much like seasons, shift over time. Early harmony can be disrupted by later tensions. Introducing an external mediator—a respected elder or community leader—may reconcile differences. Families should remain flexible and appreciative of supportive figures that guide toward lasting cohesion.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Social standing often rises with initial achievements, yet public perception can change unexpectedly. Encountering influential allies can protect or enhance one’s reputation during turbulent periods. Building genuine relationships and staying attuned to the broader social climate ensures that reputation remains resilient.",
