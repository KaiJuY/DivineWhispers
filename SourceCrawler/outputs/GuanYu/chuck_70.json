    "zh": "這首詩的主題是自然與人心的和諧。它說明天候由天意掌控，而人若以至誠禱告，心中無疑，便能換得甘霖。詩中提到「雷雨風雲各有司」顯示天地間有序；「至誠禱告莫生疑」則提醒誠實與信念是祈求之關鍵；「與君定約為霖日」寓意堅定的願望能得到實現；最後「正是蘊隆中伏時」指出此時正是隱忍與等待的階段。整體寓意在於，雖然風雨無常，但透過誠心與恆久的期盼，命運仍可被改寫，且要把握適當的時機以迎接轉機。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that while natural forces such as thunder, rain, and wind are governed by a higher order, sincere human intent and steadfast hope can influence outcomes, especially during periods of hidden turmoil. The poem urges patience, honest prayer, and mindful waiting, highlighting that destiny is neither wholly rigid nor entirely random; rather, it is shaped by the interplay between cosmic will and individual resolve. \n\n1. Health: Belief in sincere supplication can inspire confidence in healing processes. The mention of rain as nourishment reflects that natural elements can bring relief. Patience during the “inner hidden period” mirrors the recovery phase after illness. \n\n2. Love and Relationships: The promise of rain symbolizes renewal in partnerships. Trusting that earnest commitment leads to fulfillment encourages open communication. Timing, as noted in the poem, suggests waiting for the right moment enhances harmony. \n\n3. Career and Ambition: Steadfast desire, like the pledge for rain, indicates the importance of clear goals. The poem cautions against hasty pursuit, advising persistence during “hidden turmoil.” Success follows when effort aligns with the cosmic rhythm. \n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Rain is often associated with abundance; the poem implies that sincere effort may attract prosperity. The hidden phase suggests refraining from impulsive decisions, favoring measured planning. Financial stability grows when one balances ambition with patience. \n\n5. Family and Harmony: Family bonds can be fortified through honest prayers and mutual support. The poem’s emphasis on waiting underscores the value of patience in resolving conflicts. fighter Harmony is achieved when members align their intentions with shared values. \n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Public perception depends on genuine conduct; sincere efforts are less likely to be doubted. The poem’s assurance that doubts will not arise encourages integrity in interactions. Reputation flourishes when actions reflect heartfelt resolve.",
