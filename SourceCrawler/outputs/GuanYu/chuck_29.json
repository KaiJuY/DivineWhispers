The third line, 'If one continues diligent cultivation without fatigue,' urges persistent self-cultivation to perpetuate ancestral virtue. The closing line, 'Heaven will return the old green blanket to you,' symbolizes divine recompense, promising that steadfast virtue will ultimately be rewarded like the ancient green cloth, representing purity and longevity. Overall, the poem presents a positive cycle that emphasizes the mutual influence of personal cultivation and family honor, implying that only by upholding goodness can one receive divine and worldly blessings.",
