    "zh": "這首詩的主題是說明過去努力徒勞，隨著新春到來，運勢逐漸好轉，所有計畫皆得如意。然而仍需警惕不自量力，保持謹慎與恬淡，以免因貪心與高傲而失去本來的福祉。詩中以歷史感的語調，告示世人，過去的種種計謀若不慎，終將成空；但當新春之氣漸入臨時，時勢悄然轉好，百計皆能得意。仍提醒成功並非無懈可擊，必須把握心態，避免貪婪與自高自大，因為唯有謙恭、恬淡之心，方能長久守住本來的福祉與安寧。若不守己，易被外物牽動，心神失衡，往往導致逆境。故此，詩中提倡以靜若止水之姿，順應天運，耐心等待，以求得最終的成功與和諧。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the revelation that past endeavors were in vain, yet as the new year approaches, fortune gradually improves and all plans come to fruition. Still, one must guard against overconfidence, maintain caution and tranquility, for only through restraint and humility can lasting blessings and peace be preserved. The poem, written in a reflective tone, warns that if earlier schemes are misused they will become empty; however, when the spring spirit enters, circumstances subtly shift, and every plan can succeed. It reminds us that success is not invincible; one must keep one’s mindset in check, avoid greed and hubris, because only a modest, calm heart can sustain enduring well‑being and serenity. Without self‑discipline, external forces can disturb balance, often leading to adversity. Therefore, the poem advocates a still‑water posture, aligning with destiny, patiently waiting to achieve final success and harmony.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that while past efforts may seem futile, the arrival of the new year brings a gradual shift in fortune, allowing plans to prosper. Yet the poem cautions against overconfidence and urges a steady, humble approach to maintain long‑term prosperity and peace.\n\n1. Health: The poem’s message of gradual improvement suggests that patience and self‑discipline can enhance overall well‑being. By staying vigilant against pride, one can avoid health pitfalls caused by stress and over‑exertion.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: It warns that success in matters of the heart depends on humility and attentiveness. Cultivating a modest, attentive attitude fosters deeper, more stable connections.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The poem implies that career gains arise when one aligns effort with the right timing. Patience and restraint allow opportunities to materialize, rather than forcing results.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Financial growth is portrayed as a result of prudent planning and humility. Greed and arrogance can disrupt wealth accumulation; instead, steady, careful investment yields lasting gains.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Maintaining a humble, calm demeanor at home creates harmony. Excessive pride or over‑ambition can cause discord, while a balanced approach nurtures unity.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Reputation flourishes when one behaves modestly and avoids excess. The poem encourages a steady, respectful engagement with others to preserve and enhance social standing.",
