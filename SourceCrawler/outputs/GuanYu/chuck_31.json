    "zh": "這首詩的主題是秋冬的平凡與春天的漸進富貴。詩中以四句語言描繪四季變遷與人情往來：首句說明秋冬時節工作平平，未能顯現成效；次句指出春到之際，門庭事業會隨之升騰，暗示時間的推移帶來機會；第三句把遠距離的信音比作千里傳來的訊息，象徵期待與鼓勵；最後一句則表達雖然人間快樂尚未達到巔峰，但仍在進展之中。整體而言，詩人提醒人們在秋冬時節保持穩健、耐心，等待春天來臨時，方能收穫順利與吉祥。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the ordinary nature of autumn and winter, and the gradual prosperity that spring brings. The poem uses four lines to depict the changing seasons and human interactions: the first line explains that in autumn and winter work remains ordinary, lacking significant results; the second line points out that when spring arrives, the household and career will rise with it, implying that time brings opportunities; the third line likens distant messages to signals sent from afar, symbolizing hope and encouragement; the last line expresses that although worldly happiness has not yet reached its peak, it is still progressing. Overall, the poet reminds people to stay steady and patient in autumn and winter, waiting for spring to arrive, so that success and good fortune can be realized.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは秋冬の平凡さと春の順次的な豊かさです。詩は四行で季節の移ろいや人間関係を描写します。第一行は秋冬の仕事が普通で成果が出にくいことを示し、第二行は春が来ると家内事業が上昇し、時間が機会をもたらすことを示唆します。第三行では遠くからのメッセージを千里の音符に例え、期待と励ましを象徴しています。最後の行は世俗の幸せはまだ頂点に達していないが、進展中であることを示しています。全体として、詩人は秋冬の間に安定と忍耐を保ち、春の到来を待つことで成功と幸運を得られると促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that human endeavors are ordinary during the austere seasons of autumn and winter, but the arrival of spring heralds gradual improvement and eventual success. The verses illustrate a progression from stagnation to hopeful anticipation, underscoring the necessity of patience, steady effort, and receptive communication. The message is universally applicable: by maintaining perseverance and openness to change, one can transform temporary difficulties into sustainable growth.\n\n1. Health – The poem’s suggestion that difficulties in the colder months are merely ordinary hints at a natural ebb and flow of vitality. One should allow time for recovery and expect gradual healing, rather than rushing treatments.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – The gradual rise of prosperity with spring reflects the development of relationships. Relationships that start slowly but steadily can grow into stronger bonds, emphasizing patience and communication.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – The verses highlight that achievements in business or personal ambition will appear after the patience of autumn and winter. A steady, incremental approach is advised over sudden leaps.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – Financial gains are portrayed as arising over time, especially after the calm period. This encourages disciplined saving and investment, trusting that prosperity will build slowly.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – The poem speaks of distant communication and hope. Family members should maintain openness, listening, and support during the “winter” phases to achieve harmonious reunions in the “spring.”\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The gradual, incremental prosperity indicates that reputation is earned through consistent, reliable actions. Maintaining steady conduct over time ensures that social standing improves in due course.",
