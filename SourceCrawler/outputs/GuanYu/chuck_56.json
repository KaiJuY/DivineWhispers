    "zh": "這首詩的主題是自我欺騙與法律制裁。首句「心頭理曲強詞遮」揭示當事人企圖以巧言隱瞞錯誤，隱藏真相；接著「直欲欺官行路斜」說明他欲以不正之道挑戰公權。第三句「一旦醜形臨月鏡」比喻行為最終將被揭露，正如月光照亮陰影；最後「身投憲網莫咨嗟」則警示，若被捲入法律網羅，已無悔恨之餘地。整體敘事提醒，任何企圖用欺瞞逃避正義的行為，終將因天理昭彰而遭遇嚴厲懲罰，故應審慎行事、以誠實守法為先。",
    "en": "The theme of this poem is self-deception and legal retribution. The opening line “Heart conceals the truth, strong words hide it” reveals the protagonist’s attempt to mask mistakes with clever speech, concealing reality; the next line “Intends to deceive the officials and walk a crooked path” indicates the desire to confront authority through illicit means. The third line “Once the ugly form appears before the moon’s mirror” metaphorically shows that actions will eventually be exposed, as the moonlight illuminates shadows; the final line “Throwing oneself into the legal net, no remorse can be begged” warns that once trapped in the law’s web, there is no room for regret. The narrative as a whole reminds that any attempt to escape justice through deception will ultimately be punished by obvious moral law, thus one should act prudently and prioritize honesty and legality.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは自己欺瞞と法的制裁である。冒頭の「心頭理曲強詞遮」は、詩人が巧言で過ちを隠し、真実を覆い隠そうとする姿を示す。続く「直欲欺官行路斜」は、官権に対して不正に挑む意思を示す。三番「一旦醜形臨月鏡」は、行為が月光に照らされて露呈する比喩であり、最後の「身投憲網莫咨嗟」は、法網に捕らわれた後には悔いを言い訳できない警告である。全体として、欺瞞で正義を逃れようとする行為は、天の理により厳しく罰せられることを戒め、誠実と法令順守を優先すべきだと示唆している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a stern admonition against deceitful conduct and a reminder that justice, when exposed, cannot be evaded. The verses trace a trajectory from deliberate concealment (“心頭理曲強詞遮”) to active subversion of authority (“直欲欺官行路斜”), culminating in inevitable revelation and irrevocable accountability (“一旦醜形臨月鏡” and “身投憲網莫咨嗟”). This progression illustrates that any attempt to manipulate or dodge the law is doomed to fail, and that remorse is futile once the truth has surfaced.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem implies that one’s “ugly form” will be exposed; metaphorically, it warns that hidden ailments or irresponsible behavior will eventually manifest and require intervention, emphasizing the importance of honesty in medical practice and self‑care.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The caution against “欺官” indicates the need for integrity in interpersonal dealings; any deceit in affection or partnership will be revealed and erode trust, suggesting transparent communication is essential.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The verses criticize using illegitimate means to advance; professional success rooted in dishonesty is fleeting, and one must pursue achievements through ethical channels to sustain long‑term reputation.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The lines advise against “強詞” for wealth; it warns that financial gains acquired through manipulation or fraud are unsustainable and will attract legal scrutiny, urging prudent, lawful financial planning.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The poem’s reminder that “身投憲網” leaves no regret underscores that actions affecting family can be unforgivable; maintaining harmony requires sincere responsibility and avoiding deceitful conduct that could damage familial bonds.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The final admonition “莫咨嗟_Remove” highlights the irreversible impact of deceit on one’s public standing; a reputation built on mistruths erodes once exposed, so cultivating trustworthiness in social circles safeguards one’s social capital.",
