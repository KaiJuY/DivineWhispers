    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對於現世繁雜事務的警示與內心安寧的訓示。作者以崆峒城的喧鬧比喻世間萬事紛繁，指出在這樣的環境中仍能保持平靜的“無事如君有幾家”是一種難得的境界。詩人勸示不必過度執著於禱告或奮鬥，因為徒勞的努力往往只會添添煩惱，最終只剩苦咨嘆。重點在於接受當下、淡化慾望，將精力放在靜觀內心，避免因妄求而招來禍端。",
    "en": "The theme of this poem is a warning about the clutter of worldly affairs and a lesson on inner tranquility. The poet likens the bustling situation of the Kangdong city to the chaotic nature of life, pointing out that maintaining calmness amid such a setting—“even in peace, how few families do you have”—is a rare state. He advises against excessive attachment to prayer or hard toil, because futile effort only adds distress, ultimately leaving only sighs. The focus is on accepting the present, downplaying desires, and directing energy toward quiet observation of the inner self, thereby preventing harm caused by ill‑intended yearning.",
    "jp": "この詩の主題は、世の中の煩雑な事務への警告と内なる安寧への訓示である。詩人は崆峒城の騒がしさを人生の混沌と比較し、そのような環境の中で平静を保てること――「無事は君の数家に匹敵しない」――を珍しい状態と指摘する。彼は、祈りや努力に執着しすぎないよう勧め、徒労はただ苦悩を増やすだけで、結局は苦しみを残すと説く。中心は現在を受け入れ、欲望を和らげ、内面を静かに観察することにエネルギーを向け、妄求が招く危害を防ぐことである。",
    "reference": "正史稱。宋。楊文廣。延昭子。從狄青南征。儂智高為廣西鈐轄。兵陷柳州。青救之。與野史云。文廣係宗之子。陷柳州被困。楊家諸女將往救焉。傳術迥異。姑併錄之。仍宜從正史為是。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that worldly affairs can be overwhelmingly chaotic, yet maintaining inner calm and accepting the present can prevent unnecessary suffering. The verses advise against obsessive prayer or labor, noting that futile effort only adds distress, ultimately leaving only sighs. The poem promotes a tranquil mindset, humility in desire, and a focus on quiet self‑reflection to avoid harm from ill‑intended yearning.\n\n1. Health: The poem encourages a calm mindset, which reduces stress and supports physical well‑being. By avoiding excessive worry and unnecessary exertion, one can maintain a balanced state of health. Practicing mindfulness and acceptance can help mitigate tension‑related ailments.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The message of non‑attachment is relevant to interpersonal harmony. By accepting the present and not clinging to idealized expectations, relationships can flourish without resentment. Mutual respect and open communication become easier when both parties value tranquility over control.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Ambitious endeavors should be pursued with realistic goals. The poem cautions against blind pursuit that leads to frustration. A balanced approach, aligning effort with acceptance, can lead to sustainable progress without burnout.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The verses imply that excessive pursuit of material gain is futile. A pragmatic mindset, accepting what one has, can prevent financial missteps. Smart budgeting and measured investment, rather than reckless pursuit, align with the poem’s counsel.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The guidance to accept the present extends to family life. By acknowledging the ordinary rhythm of home, conflicts can be avoided. Encouraging calmness and listening within the household supports lasting harmony.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The poem suggests that avoiding excessive display or striving for approval can protect reputation. By fostering genuine interactions and steady conduct, social networks strengthen without the need for dramatic gestures. Reputation grows from consistency rather than spectacle.",
