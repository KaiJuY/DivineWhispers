    "zh": "這首詩的主題是順應自然之道與天時，以保持人生與家業的安寧。乾亥之龍象徵順勢之勢，坎居午為宜居之方，皆為順理所致之安定。若改為丑艮，則為陰陽逆轉，導致門戶凋零，家道難繼。詩中以卦象寓示，提醒人們不可妄圖違逆本性，否則便會招致不利與損失。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is following the natural order and timing to maintain the tranquility of life and family. The dragon of the 亥 in 乾 represents the fortune of following the tide, and 置於午的坎 is a suitable place, both leading to stability in accordance with reason. Moving to 丑艮 is an inversion of yin and yang, resulting in the decline of the household and difficulty sustaining family prosperity. The poem uses hexagram imagery to warn against the folly of defying nature, lest one invite misfortune and loss.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、自然と時の秩序に従い、人生と家業の安寧を保つことである。乾の亥の龍は、流れに沿う運勢を表し、午に置かれた坎は適切な場所であり、両方とも理にかなった安定をもたらす。丑艮に移すことは陰陽の逆転であり、家門が衰え、家道の維持が難しくなる。詩は卦のイメージを用いて、自然に逆らう愚かな行いを警告し、逆に不運と損失を招くと示している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a caution against defying natural and moral order; the imagery of the dragon (乾亥) and the safe dwelling (坎居午) underscores the benefits of following a harmonious path, whereas shifting to an opposing direction (丑艮) brings misfortune, reflected in the decline of the household. This lesson applies broadly to personal conduct, offering insight across various facets of life:\n\n1. Health – Maintaining harmony with the body’s natural rhythms reduces illness. The poem’s call for compliance with nature suggests that disregarding bodily cues invites disease.\n2. Love and Relationships – A partnership rooted in mutual respect and alignment mirrors the stable hexagrams; deviation leads to discord and separation.\n3. Career and Ambition – Progress that aligns with one’s true talents and circumstances yields sustainable success; abrupt pivots or unrealistic expectations can result in professional setbacks.\n4. Wealth and Finances – Prudence and careful planning, akin to the wise placement of 坎居午, guard against financial loss; hasty or ill‑judged investments mirror the perilous shift to 丑艮.\n5. Family and Harmony – Consistent adherence to shared values keeps the family structure intact; neglecting collective traditions can erode cohesion, just as the poem warns of a decaying household.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – Building networks through integrity and consistency reflects the poem’s guidance on following proper order; rash actions or dishonesty may tarnish one’s standing and lead to isolation.",
