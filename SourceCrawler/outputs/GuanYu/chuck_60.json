    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、兄弟の絆と謙虚さがもたらす栄光と将来への道を示すことです。最初の行では兄弟の名声を称賛し、次に「只管謙撝莫自矜」で自惚れを戒め、傲慢さが運を削げることを指摘します。三行目の「丹詔槐黃相逼近」は天子の詔書と吉兆を象徴し、兄弟が試験で順調に科甲に進入することを暗示します。最後の行「巍巍科甲兩同登」は両兄弟が同時に最上位に昇ることを強調し、明るい未来と共に進むキャリアを示します。詩全体は肯定と戒めを併せ持ち、謙虚さを保ち続け、順調な旅を期待させます。",
    "reference": "宋。宋郊。弟都。雍邱人。天聖初與弟同舉進士。未第時。有僧相之云。小宋當大魁天下。大宋亦不失功名。後數日僧見郊。異之曰。君何滿面陰騭紋。似救數萬生命者。郊曰惟前日見蟻被水掩。戲將竹編橋渡之。僧曰即此便是當大魁天下。後果然。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that while external acclaim and successful advancement can be achieved, they must be accompanied by humility and a steady moral foundation to sustain long‑term prosperity. The poem’s four lines first commend the brothers’ noble reputation, then admonish against arrogance, and finally herald the arrival of imperial favor that will let both brothers ascend to the highest scholarly rank simultaneously. The underlying message is that reputation and success are gifts that should be handled with modesty, and that divine or royal endorsement can secure a bright future if one remains grounded.\n\n1. Health: The admonition against self‑boast implies that pride can negatively affect one’s health. By maintaining humility, the brothers are less likely to encounter mental or physical strain.\n2. Love and Relationships: Brotherly affection is celebrated; the poem encourages sustaining harmonious relationships built on respect rather than competition.\n3. Career and Ambition: The arrival of the imperial decree symbolizes career advancement; humility enables smoother promotions and shared success.\n4. Wealth and Finances: Successful examinations can lead to financial gains. The poem suggests that modest earnings are attainable when ambition is tempered by humility.\n5. Family and Harmony: The joint ascension of both brothers indicates that family achievements are amplified when each member supports the other.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Reputation gains are praised, but only if accompanied by humility; thus, social standing is reinforced by consistent modest behavior.",
