    "zh": "這首詩的主題是「不應以欺詐為樂，須遵守誠信與法度」。詩中以「假君財物自當還」敘述借物應歸還，若心存欺騙，則「謀賴心欺他自奸」自將受害。後半段「幸有高臺明月鏡」象徵官府正義之光，當真相顯露時，必將「請來對照破機關」，意即被法律追究。整體語氣警示人們，任何以欺詐取利的行為，終究會被明鏡照見，招致責任。保持正直、守信，是自保之道。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is \"One should not find joy in deceit; one must uphold sincerity and lawfulness.\" The verses describe that borrowed property must be returned, and if one harbors intent to deceive, then \"scheming with a false heart will bring one's own ruin.\" The latter part, \"Fortunately there is a high tower with a bright moon mirror,\" symbolizes the illumination of justice; when truth is revealed, one will \"be called to compare and dismantle the machinery,\" meaning being prosecuted by law. Overall, the poem warns that any attempt to profit through deceit will inevitably be exposed by the shining mirror and result in accountability. Maintaining integrity and faithfulness is the path to self‑protection.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは『詐欺で喜びを見出してはならず、誠実と法令を守らねばならない』です。詩は借物は返すべきであり、欺く心を抱けば『偽りの心で他人を騙し、己が災いを招く』と語っています。後半の『幸いに高台の明月鏡』は官府の正義の光を象徴し、真実が明らかになると『請来対照破機関』、すなわち法の裁きを受けることを意味します。全体として、詐欺で利益を得ようとする行為は、光り輝く鏡に照らされて必ず責任を負うことを警告しています。正直で信頼を保つことが自己防衛の道です。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that deceitful behavior will inevitably lead to accountability, and that one must maintain honesty and uphold justice. The poem uses the imagery of borrowed goods and the bright moon mirror to symbolize the return of what is owed and the revealing power of truth. It cautions that those who seek to gain through deception will eventually face legal judgment. The overall lesson is that integrity and responsibility are essential for personal and social wellbeing.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem implicitly suggests that a dishonest mindset can harm one’s well‑being. By staying truthful and responsible, one reduces mental stress and fosters a stable, healthy life.\n2. Love and Relationships\n   In relationships, the message encourages transparency and fairness. Avoiding manipulation ensures stronger bonds and a harmonious partnership.\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Professional conduct must align with ethical standards. The poem warns that ambition achieved through deception will ultimately backfire, jeopardizing career progression.\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Financial success built on borrowed or illicit gains is unsustainable. The verse advises that rightful stewardship and restitution will secure lasting wealth.\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Within the family, honesty promotes unity. The poem highlights that hidden malice will erode trust, whereas sincere action nurtures familial harmony.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Public perception is shaped by actions. The poem illustrates that a reputation founded on deceit will be exposed, damaging one’s social standing and credibility.\n\nIn sum, the poem’s message is a universal reminder that integrity safeguards every facet of life, while deception inevitably attracts scrutiny and consequences.",
