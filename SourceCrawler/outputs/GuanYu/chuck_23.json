    "zh": "這首詩的主題是人生的盛衰與空虛。春風裡，花開又謝，象徵人生百歲之中，貴賤窮通的循環；貴賤無常，榮華富貴如煙雲，終究皆成空。詩中提醒，盛運時宜警惕，避免因為一時名利而忽略後患；衰運時則不必怨嘆，順其自然，因氣數之循環不可強求。整體而言，此籤詩主張對命運保持平和心態，既不過度執著於外在成就，也不放棄內在修為，因為成敗與吉凶皆是暫時，真實之道在於接受與調適。",
    "en": "This poem’s theme is the rise and fall of life and its emptiness. In the spring breeze, flowers bloom and wither, symbolizing the cycle of nobility and poverty within a hundred years of life; the fluctuation of status is transient, and the splendor and wealth dissolve like mist, ultimately becoming void. The poem cautions that during prosperous times one should be vigilant to avoid neglecting future dangers due to temporary fame and fortune; during declining fortunes, one need not lament, but rather accept the natural cycle, for the ebb and flow of destiny cannot be forced. Overall, this lot poem advocates maintaining a calm attitude toward fate, neither obsessing over external accomplishments nor abandoning inner cultivation, for success and failure, fortune and misfortune are all temporary; the true path lies in acceptance and adjustment.",
    "jp": "この詩の主題は人生の盛衰と虚無である。春風の中、花が咲き、また散ることは、百歳の人生における貴賤や貧富の循環を象徴しており、貴賤の無常さと、栄華富貴は煙のように消えて最終的に空になることを示している。詩は盛り盛りの時に警戒し、一時の名利により後の危険を見落とさないよう注意し、衰退期には怨みを抱く必要はなく、自然の流れを受け入れ、運命の循環は強要できないと告げている。総じて、この籤詩は運命に対して平穏な心構えを保ち、外面的な成就に執着せず、内面的な修養も放棄せず、成敗や吉凶は一時的であるとし、真の道は受容と調整にあると主張している。",
    "reference": "吳既滅越。越王勾踐。卑詞請成。臥薪嘗膽。果報會稽之仇。與大夫范蠡。文種謀。乃選民間絕色西施女。進之吳王。夫差甚嬖愛之。至於亡國。"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the fleeting nature of worldly achievements is comparable to the blooming and withering of flowers in the spring wind; the cycle of status, wealth, and honor is transient and ultimately dissolves into emptiness. The poem offers a balanced perspective: during prosperous times one must exercise vigilance to avoid neglecting future dangers, while during decline one should not lament but accept the natural flow of fate, recognizing that success, fortune, and misfortune are temporary. It encourages a calm, non‑attachment attitude toward external accomplishments, valuing inner cultivation and adjustment as the true path.\n\n1. Health – The poem suggests that if disease is present, it may intensify during this lot; therefore, one should monitor health closely and seek timely medical care.\n2. Love and Relationships – Marriage or strong romantic bonds are unlikely to flourish; one may find it difficult to establish a lasting partnership under this influence.\n3. Career and Ambition – Success in professional endeavors is fleeting; sustained effort and prudent planning are essential to maintain progress without overreaching.\n4. Wealth and Finances – Material gains may appear briefly but are likely to dissipate; prudent saving, risk management, and avoidance of speculative ventures are advisable.\n5. Family and Harmony – While the poem does not directly address family, the overarching theme urges maintaining peace by accepting change and avoiding over‑emphasis on status within family dynamics.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – Public acclaim is transient; cultivating sincere, modest relationships and preserving integrity help sustain long‑term respect.\n",
