    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於在逆境中忍受痛苦與辱罵，並期待陽光照耀之後才能積極規劃人生。詩中提及「苦病兼防辱」暗示身心困擾與外界排斥；「乘危亦未穌」則說明危機雖至，尚未結束，提醒行者須保持警覺。唯有等「一陽」升起，即象徵希望或善緣的到來，方能「作良圖」，以穩健之策面對未來。整體語調沉穩，鼓勵人在苦難後保持耐心與計畫性，等待好機會再出發。此詩亦提醒人在面對逆境時，勿以短視為念，應先觀察內心與外在環境，積蓄力量，待機會來臨再行動。最後，詩句以『方可作良圖』作結，象徵只有在逆境過後，才能確立正確的計畫與方向，為未來奠定堅實基礎。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about enduring suffering and insults in adversity, and anticipating the moment when the sun rises to plan life actively. The poem mentions '苦病兼防辱', indicating mental distress and external rejection; '乘危亦未穌' says that although danger arrives, it has not ended yet, urging vigilance. Only when '一陽' rises, symbolizing hope or good fortune, can one '作良圖', to adopt a steady plan to face the future. The overall tone is calm, encouraging patience and planning after hardship, waiting for a good opportunity to move forward. It also reminds one not to be shortsighted in adversity, to observe inner and outer environments, accumulate strength, and act when the opportunity comes. Finally, the ending '方可作良圖' symbolizes that only after adversity can one establish a correct plan and direction, laying a solid foundation for the future.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、逆境の中で苦痛と侮辱に耐え、太陽が昇る瞬間を待って人生を積極的に計画することです。詩では『苦病兼防辱』が精神的な苦悩と外部からの拒絶を示し、『乗危亦未穌』は危機が来てもまだ終わっていないことを警戒を促します。『一陽』が昇る、すなわち希望や福祉が訪れると、安定した計画で未来に臨むことができると示されています。全体的に落ち着いた調子で、苦難の後に忍耐と計画を保ち、良い機会を待つよう促します。また、逆境に直面したときに短視に陥らず、内面と外面を観察し、力を蓄え、機会が来たら行動することを提案しています。最後に『方可作良図』という結びで、逆境の後で正しい計画と方向を確立でき、将来の堅固な基盤を築くことが象徴されています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a reminder that hardship and insult are inevitable, yet perseverance and the right timing will lead to better prospects. The poem uses vivid imagery to illustrate the stages of suffering, the pause before relief, and the importance of planning. The phrase \"苦病兼防辱\" highlights both inner pain and external rejection, while \"乘危亦未穌\" indicates that danger has arrived but is not yet concluded. Only when \"一陽\" rises—symbolising hope or a favourable turn—can one \"作良圖\", thereby establishing a stable strategy for the future. The overall tone is calm, urging patience and intentionality until a favourable opportunity presents itself.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s reference to \"苦病\" underscores the importance of acknowledging physical or mental illness. It advises a patient, measured approach to recovery, waiting for the right moment before initiating decisive treatment or lifestyle changes. A mindful routine of rest and gradual improvement will ultimately restore well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe mention of \"防辱\" suggests that external judgement or criticism may strain relationships. The text advises maintaining dignity and composure, yet not allowing insults to derail one’s intentions. When the positive light of \"一陽\" appears, emotional bonds can be rekindled with renewed respect and understanding.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n\"乘危亦未穌\" warns that a professional setback may still be reversible. The poem encourages strategic planning and patience until the right opportunity—symbolised by \"一陽\"—arises. At that point, a well‑crafted plan can lead to career advancement or a new venture.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial hardship is implied by the overall tone of endurance. The text advises a cautious approach to spending and a focus on long‑term security. Once the hopeful phase emerges, prudent investments or careful budgeting can stabilise finances.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe dual themes of internal pain and external insult reflect familial tensions. The poem recommends holding steady and preserving harmony through open communication. With the arrival of \"一陽\", families can realign and rebuild trust, creating a supportive environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nExternal criticism can tarnish one’s reputation. The text suggests maintaining integrity and resilience in the face of adversity. When circumstances improve, proactive engagement and thoughtful networking can restore social standing and foster new alliances.",
