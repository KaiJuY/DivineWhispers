    "en": "This poem's theme is a praise for cultivation, loyalty, and transcendence. Though the deep mountains are hidden, they are fertile ground for training the heart and seeking the true way. The loyal emperor declares that loyalty and righteousness receive heavenly mandate, symbolizing moral cultivation and smooth governance. The phoenix and roc fly together, awakening the spirit of justice within hearts, implying that brilliance and virtue coexist. Finally rising beyond the nine heavens symbolizes the heart breaking its limits and reaching higher realms, calling for continued effort and far‑reaching aspirations. Overall, it conveys self‑purification, sincere practice, and the relentless pursuit of higher spiritual goals.",
    "jp": "この詩の主題は、修行・忠誠・超越への賛歌です。深い山は隠れた場所であるが、心を鍛え真道を求めるための肥沃な土壌です。忠実な皇帝は忠誠と正直が天命を得ると宣言し、道徳修養と事業の円滑さを象徴します。鳳凰と鸞がともに飛び、心の中の正義の魂を覚醒させ、光と善徳が共存することを示します。最後に九つの天を越えて上昇することは、人の心が制限を突破し、より高い境地に達することを象徴し、継続的な努力と遠大な志向を呼びかけます。全体として、自己浄化、誠実な実践、そしてより高い精神的目標への永続的な追求を伝えます。",
