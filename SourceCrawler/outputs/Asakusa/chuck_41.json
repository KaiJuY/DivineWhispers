    "zh": "詩歌以『有物不周旋』表現現實中雖有許多事物，但難以把握；『須防損半邊』提醒須防止失去或貿然半途而斷；『家鄉煙火裡』暗示在熟悉環境中仍可能遇到火災等危險；最後的『祈福始安然』則說明透過誠心祈福，方能得到平安與安寧。",
    "en": "The poem begins with “有物不周旋” to convey that although many things are available, they are difficult to obtain or hold; “須防損半邊” warns of the danger of losing or giving up half the effort; “家鄉煙火裡” suggests that even in familiar surroundings there may be fire hazards; finally, “祈福始安然” indicates that sincere prayers can bring peace and security.",
    "jp": "詩は「有物不周旋」で、多くの物があるが手に入れにくいことを示し、「須防損半邊」で半分の努力を失う危険を警告し、「家鄉煙火裡」で馴染みのある環境でも火災の危険が潜んでいることを暗示し、最後に「祈福始安然」で真摯な祈りが平安をもたらすことを示唆しています。",
