    "zh": "這首詩的主題是透過自然象徵表現行動與前進的決心。紅雲隨步起，暗示走在正確的道路上會看到吉兆；一箭中青霄則比喻向遠方或理想投射出目標，能輕易命中。鹿行千里遠象徵遠距離的旅程，但若自負而忽略當前環境，便會失去方向。爭知去路遙提醒過度自信可能帶來失敗，真正的成功需先從全盤判斷、誠實評估開始，並勇於行動。",
    "en": "這首詩的主題是... The poem uses natural imagery to convey a sense of decisive action and forward movement. The rising red clouds that follow the steps signify auspicious signs that come from staying on the right path. The line \"一箭中青霄\" (a single arrow hits the high sky) metaphorises setting a lofty aim and hitting it with ease. The wandering deer that travels a thousand miles reminds us of long journeys, yet pride and neglect of the present can cause us to lose our way. The final line warns that overconfidence can lead to failure; genuine success comes from thorough assessment, honesty, and decisive action.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is:\n- The rising red clouds that follow the steps suggest auspicious signs on the right path.\n- The single arrow hitting the high sky represents setting and achieving clear, lofty goals.\n- The deer traveling a thousand miles symbolizes long journeys, but pride and neglect of the present can lead to lost direction.\n- The concluding line cautions that overconfidence can bring failure; genuine success requires thorough judgment, honesty, and decisive action rather than relying solely on self‑confidence.",
