    "en": "These verses primarily caution readers to exercise restraint in speech during social interactions, particularly when intoxicated, as words spoken under the influence should not be taken as absolute truth. The poem advises avoiding conversations with those of lesser standing, as such interactions may tarnish one's own reputation. It emphasizes the importance of sincerity toward others and the respect owed to elders and divine beings; adherence to these principles will attract the benevolent protection of the '陰公', enabling one to fulfill wishes and dispel hostility. Ultimately, by following this guidance, inner peace and happiness will ensue.",
    "jp": "この詩は、人々に交流や会話の際に慎重に行動し、酒に酔って無責任に語った言葉を真実と受け取らないよう注意を促すことを主題としています。詩はまた、身分の低い相手との会話を避け、自己の評価を損ねないようにすべきだと忠告します。さらに、他者への誠実さと年長者や神仏への敬意を大切にすることで、陰公の恩恵を受け、願望を実現し、敵意を消し去ることができると述べています。こうした指針に従うことで、内なる平安と幸福が得られるのです。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a guidance on prudent communication and respectful conduct in social settings. It highlights the pitfalls of speaking indiscriminately, especially while under the influence of alcohol, and warns against engaging with those of lower standing, which can tarnish one’s reputation. The verses advocate for sincerity, respect towards elders, and reverence for divine or Buddhist principles, suggesting that such behavior will attract benevolent forces (the “陰公”) that help realize one's wishes and neutralize hostility. By embracing these teachings, the poem assures the reader that inner peace and happiness can be achieved.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s caution about alcohol and careless speech indirectly reminds one to watch for the physical and mental strain that excessive drinking can impose. Mindful consumption and a calm demeanor are implied to protect one's well‑being.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – Respect for elders and the importance of sincerity signal healthy relational dynamics. Avoiding lower‑standing companions serves as a metaphor for maintaining integrity and avoiding toxic associations in romantic or platonic bonds.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The notion that proper conduct and reverence will attract protective forces can be interpreted as career advice: honesty, humility, and respect can open doors and safeguard professional progress.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – While not overtly about money, the poem’s message that careful speech and respectful interaction prevent negative outcomes can be applied to financial prudence; gossip and careless promises often lead to loss.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Emphasizing respect for elders naturally extends to family life. Harmonious relationships are fostered when one treats relatives with sincerity and avoids unnecessary conflicts.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The clear warning against engaging with those of lesser standing highlights the impact of social associations on reputation. Maintaining a network of respectful, like‑minded individuals protects one's social standing and ensures a positive communal image.",
