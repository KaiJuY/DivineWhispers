    "en": "This poem's theme is a dual examination of the future and the inner self. The opening line, 'Gem and stone yet unseparated,' serves as a metaphor for situations that remain indistinguishable at the outset, indicating a phase of ambiguity or flux. The second line, 'Worry turns to deeper sorrow,' conveys how anxiety intensifies over time, shifting from mere unease to a profound sadness, urging caution in handling internal concerns. The third line, 'The path ahead opens wide,' offers a hopeful outlook, suggesting that steadfast adherence to a righteous course and patient waiting will eventually reveal a clear trajectory. Finally, 'Flowers bloom upon barren branches' symbolizes that even in desolate circumstances new blossoms may arise, implying that hardship can still foster renewal and opportunity. Overall, the concise quartet of lines progressively guides the reader to remain calm and persevere during uncertainty, ultimately discovering light amid adversity.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、未来と内面の二重の検討です。冒頭の『玉石未分時』は、物事がまだ明確にならない段階で区別が難しいことを比喩し、曖昧さや変動の段階を示唆しています。二番目の『憂心転悲』は、憂慮が時間とともに深刻化し、心配が悲しみに変わる様子を表し、内面的な問題に慎重に対処する必要性を示唆します。三番目の『前途通大道』は、正しい道を堅持し忍耐強く待つことで、最終的に明確な道が見えることを示唆しています。最後の『花発応残枝』は、枯れた枝でも新しい花が咲く可能性があり、逆境の中でも再生と機会が存在することを象徴しています。全体として、四句の簡潔な構成が段階的に進行し、不確実な時期に冷静さと前進を保つよう促し、最終的に困難の中に光を見出すことを示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a contemplative reflection on the transient nature of certainty and the resilience that emerges when one persists through ambiguity. The opening line, “玉石未分時” (gem and stone yet unseparated), acknowledges that in the early stages of any situation one cannot yet discern value from worth. The second line, “憂心轉更悲” (worry turns into deeper sorrow), warns that unresolved anxieties can intensify, transforming light unease into profound melancholy. Yet the third line, “前途通大道” (the path ahead opens wide), offers a reassuring promise that perseverance on the right path will eventually reveal a clear course. Finally, “花發應殘枝” (flowers bloom upon barren branches) encapsulates the idea that even in the most desolate conditions, new growth can emerge, signifying hope and renewal. Together, the four lines urge the reader to maintain composure, continue striving, and ultimately find brightness even amid hardship.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem cautions that unaddressed worries can deepen into significant distress, underscoring the importance of early attention to physical and mental well‑being. Acknowledging subtle signs of fatigue or anxiety can prevent the escalation into more serious conditions. Consistent self‑care and vigilance are therefore essential to maintaining long‑term health.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe progression from uncertainty to clarity mirrors relational development: initial ambiguity may cloud judgment, but persistence and honest communication can illuminate a stable path. By confronting doubts early, partners can avoid misunderstandings that may turn into deeper sorrow. This approach fosters trust and mutual growth.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nThe verse suggests that unclear beginnings often precede clear direction; perseverance in one’s chosen path ultimately leads to professional success. Remaining patient during formative phases can reveal opportunities that were initially unseen. Thus, a measured, long‑term focus is favored over impulsive decisions.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial uncertainty is likened to the “gem and stone” dilemma, reminding that value must be assessed over time. Sound budgeting and prudent investment can transform ambiguous assets into tangible wealth. Avoiding rash expenditure preserves future security.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nWithin family dynamics, the poem warns that unresolved concerns can grow into lasting discord. Addressing issues early through open dialogue maintains harmony, while neglect may worsen conflicts. Consistent communication nurtures a supportive environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe imagery of flowers blooming on barren branches implies that even in challenging social circumstances, positive change is possible. By maintaining integrity and perseverance, one can reshape public perception and build enduring relationships. A deliberate, authentic presence is key to restoring reputation.\n",
