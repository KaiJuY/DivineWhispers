    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於在不和諧的環境中行事所帶來的風險與持續的煩惱。『作事不和同』指出，無論企圖做何事，因為與人或配偶關係不和，會使行動受阻，成果難以達成。『臨危更主凶』則提醒，危急時刻更易失敗，因環境本身帶來的不穩定性。『佳人生苦根』暗示，關係中的痛苦往往源自於心中的憂慮，尤其是與親密伴侶的相處，需警惕情緒負擔。『閑慮兩三重』描繪惰性與多重煩惱會連續累積，形成一連串的不利事件。整體而言，詩句告訴人們要注意人際關係，避免在緊張或危險情境下行事，並且需要提升自我調節，減少內心煩亂，才能降低不利影響。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the risks and persistent troubles that arise when one acts in an environment of disharmony. 'Doing matters with discord' points out that regardless of the task, the lack of harmony with others or a spouse hinders action, making results difficult to achieve. 'More peril when facing danger' warns that in critical moments the instability amplifies failure chances, as the surroundings are inherently unstable. 'Painful roots of good life' hints that the suffering within relationships often stems from internal worries, especially concerning close partners, and one must be cautious of emotional burdens. 'Idle worries multiply' portrays how laziness and multiple anxieties accumulate sequentially, creating a series of adverse events. Overall, the poem advises paying attention to interpersonal relations, avoiding actions in tense or hazardous situations, and improving self-regulation to reduce inner turmoil, thereby lowering negative impacts.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、調和の取れない環境で行動することによって生じるリスクと継続的な悩みです。『作事不和同』は、どんな仕事をしようと、他人や配偶者との関係が不和であるために行動が妨げられ、結果が得られにくいことを指摘します。『臨危更主凶』は、危険な時にさらに失敗しやすいことを警告し、環境自体が不安定であることを示します。『佳人生苦根』は、関係の痛みが内面的な不安から生じることを示し、特に親密なパートナーとの関わりに注意し、感情的な負担に気をつける必要があります。『閑慮兩三重』は、怠惰と多くの心配が連続して積み重なり、連鎖的に不利な出来事を生む様子を描きます。全体として、詩は人間関係に注意し、緊張したり危険な状況で行動しないようにし、自己調整を高め、内なる混乱を減らすことで不利な影響を軽減できると教えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that actions undertaken in an environment marked by discord and unease carry inherent risks, and that continuous inner turmoil can compound these challenges. The poem enumerates four situations that illustrate how lack of harmony, heightened danger, relational anxieties, and repetitive worries can each trigger negative outcomes. It warns that even seemingly ordinary plans may fail if the surrounding relationships are strained, and that crises become more perilous when already unsettled. The central lesson is that to mitigate suffering one must attend to interpersonal harmony, cultivate emotional balance, and adopt a disciplined, reflective mindset.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem suggests that tension in relationships can manifest as physical stress, leading to illness. By resolving conflicts and fostering supportive connections, one can reduce chronic tension and improve overall wellbeing. Mindful communication with loved ones is a key preventive measure against stress‑related ailments.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nConflict with a partner or close friend is highlighted as a source of pain. The verses urge active listening, empathy, and clear boundaries to prevent resentment from growing. By addressing discomfort early, couples can maintain mutual respect and shared happiness.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nA lack of harmony in the workplace is implied to stall progress. The poem encourages building cooperative teams and aligning goals, so that initiatives are not derailed by interpersonal friction. Strategic collaboration promotes smoother execution and achievement.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial decisions made under stress or discord are likely to result in setbacks. The verse implies that careful budgeting, transparent communication about monetary matters, and calm deliberation are essential for avoiding costly mistakes.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily dynamics that remain unresolved can create recurring “two‑three times” troubles. The poem teaches that open family dialogues, shared responsibilities, and emotional support prevent the cycle of misfortune and promote a nurturing environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe repeated warnings of “idle worries” suggest that a reputation built on tension can attract further complications. Maintaining integrity, engaging in sincere relationships, and resolving small conflicts before they snowball are strategies to preserve a positive social image and secure reliable networks.",
