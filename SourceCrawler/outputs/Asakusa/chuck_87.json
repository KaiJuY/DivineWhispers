    "en": "This poem's theme is: the discovery of unexpected treasure and the necessity of steadfast resolve. The opening line \"鑿石方逢玉\" metaphorically suggests finding precious gems within ordinary stones, reminding readers to cherish life's surprises. The next line \"淘沙始見金\" indicates that wealth and achievements require effort and selection. The third line \"青霄終有路\" conveys that even with lofty aspirations, one can find a path to success, yet without unwavering determination, fulfillment remains elusive. The poem, in its concise rhythm, delivers a clear message: during the pursuit of dreams, random rewards and continuous effort, combined with tenacious resolve, culminate in a luminous life.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは：偶然の発見と揺るぎない心意気です。冒頭の『鑿石方逢玉』は、日常の中に宝石を見つける比喩で、人生の驚きを大切にするよう促します。次の『淘沙始見金』は、金銭や成果は努力と選別の結果であることを示しています。三行目の『青霄終有路』は、高い志を持ちながらも成功への道は見えるが、揺るぎない意志がなければ成就できないと警告します。詩全体は簡潔なリズムで、夢を追い求める過程で偶然の報酬と継続的努力、そして粘り強い決意が人生を輝かせると語っています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that in life, sudden discoveries of value and steadfast determination together forge success. The first line, \"鑿石方逢玉,\" illustrates how unexpected gems may be found within ordinary stones, urging readers to recognize and appreciate unforeseen blessings. The second line, \"淘沙始見金,\" speaks to the necessity of sifting through effort and hardship to uncover true worth, implying that wealth and accomplishment are not merely handed but earned. The third line, \"青霄終有路,\" conveys that lofty aspirations ultimately have a path, yet without unshakable resolve, the journey can be thwarted. The poem’s concise rhythm reinforces that fortune is a blend of chance encounters, deliberate toil, and unwavering perseverance.\n\n1. Health: The verse implies that health, like a hidden gem, may appear unexpectedly when one takes care of themselves. It encourages vigilance and preparedness to detect subtle signs before they become serious.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: In relationships, sudden affection or reconciliation may arise from attentive listening, akin to finding jade in stone. Persistent effort and sincerity create a firm foundation for lasting bonds.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The poem suggests that career breakthroughs often result from perseverance and selective action. Ambitious goals can be achieved, but only if one remains determined amid challenges.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Financial prosperity is depicted as something that emerges after diligent filtering, echoing the idea that prudent investment and hard work are essential. Sudden windfalls are possible, yet they require wise stewardship.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The lines encourage a family environment where patience and care reveal hidden strengths. Maintaining steadfast commitment to family responsibilities promotes harmony and mutual support.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Building a reputable social circle demands continuous effort and genuine intentions. Reputation flourishes when one combines unexpected kindness with consistent reliability, ensuring lasting respect.",
