    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於境遇與心態的調和。首句「身同意不同」指出外在情況雖相同，但內心卻各有不同，提醒人們在同一環境中仍須尊重彼此的想法。月蝕暗長空則象徵突如其來的陰影與不確定性，提醒在困境中不宜急躁。輪雖常在手，卻未決定方向，說明即使擁有工具與機會，若缺乏明確目標亦難以前行。最後「魚水未相逢」比喻缺乏適合環境時，任何努力皆會失敗，強調適時尋求合適的相處方式。整體而言，詩意在於在不確定與變遷中保持內在平和，並靜待合適時機。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about harmonizing circumstances and mindset. The opening line “身同意不同” (though in the same situation, minds differ) points out that even in identical external conditions, individuals hold distinct thoughts, urging respect for others' views. “月蝕暗長空” symbolizes sudden shadows and uncertainty, warning against hurrying during hardship. “輪雖常在手” (the wheel is always in hand) yet the direction remains undecided, indicating that possessing tools and opportunities alone cannot drive progress without clear goals. Finally “魚水未相逢” (fish meets no water) metaphorically conveys that without a suitable environment, any effort will fail, stressing the importance of finding the right setting. Overall, the verse advises maintaining inner tranquility amid uncertainty and waiting for the appropriate moment.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、環境と心構えの調和について語っています。冒頭の「身同意不同」は、外部は同じでも心は異なることを示し、同じ状況でも相手の考えを尊重するべきだと促しています。「月蝕暗長空」は突発的な闇と不確実性を象徴し、困難の中で急がないよう警告しています。「輪雖常在手」では道具や機会はあるが方向が決まっていないことを示し、明確な目標なしには進歩できないと示唆します。最後の「魚水未相逢」は適切な環境がなければ努力が失敗に終わることを比喩し、適切な場を見つける重要性を強調しています。全体として、変化の中で内面の平静を保ち、適切な時期を待つことが示唆されています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a meditation on the interplay between external circumstances and internal disposition. The first line, “身同意不同,” highlights that while people may share the same surroundings, their attitudes and intentions can diverge, urging mindfulness toward differing viewpoints. The imagery of a lunar eclipse, “月蝕暗長空,” conveys an unexpected darkness that spreads across the heavens, reminding the reader that sudden setbacks or uncertainties can arise, yet the darkness is temporary. The phrase “輪雖常在手” emphasizes that tools and resources are at hand, but without a clear path, they cannot yield progress; purpose must guide action. Finally, “魚水未相逢” uses the metaphor of a fish devoid of water to illustrate that effort without the proper environment is futile, underscoring the need to align one's aspirations with the surrounding conditions. Together, these images counsel patience, introspection, and the pursuit of harmony with the world.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem warns against hastening into action when faced with uncertainty. It encourages a calm, steady approach to physical and mental well-being, suggesting that overexertion or impulsive decisions may lead to imbalance. The lunar eclipse metaphor reminds readers that temporary disruptions can occur, but with mindful care, one can maintain health through balance and resilience.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nAcknowledging that hearts may differ even in the same environment, the verse advises respect for partners' feelings. The idea that tools (communication) are present yet direction unclear teaches couples to clarify mutual goals. The fish‑water image emphasizes the necessity of a nurturing environment for love to thrive, indicating that without shared context, relationships may falter.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nHaving a “wheel in hand” yet lacking a set direction points to ambition that is untethered. The poem advises that resources alone do not guarantee success; a clear vision is essential. Patience in the face of unexpected obstacles, like the eclipse, helps maintain perseverance, and aligning one's career with an appropriate environment can prevent missteps.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial decisions should not be made impulsively. The poem’s emphasis on thoughtful alignment between means and objectives warns against reckless spending. Recognizing that wealth is a tool, not a destination, encourages disciplined budgeting and strategic planning, ensuring that prosperity is sustainable rather than fleeting.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nWithin family units, differing views are inevitable. The verse’s call for respect and understanding fosters cohesion. Aligning family activities with shared values—much like finding suitable “water” for the fish—ensures harmonious dynamics and mutual support, even during periods of external turbulence.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nMaintaining a steady, mindful demeanor sharpen social settings safeguards one’s reputation. The poem reminds that visibility of one’s character can be clouded by sudden setbacks, yet consistency builds trust. By choosing environments that reflect personal values, individuals can cultivate relationships that endure beyond fleeting circumstances.",
