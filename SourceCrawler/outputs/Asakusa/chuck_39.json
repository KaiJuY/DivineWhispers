    "en": "This poem's theme is centered on the inner wish and the warning of interwoven actionlessness and disaster. The line '望用方心腹' indicates that even if one has a wish, unless one takes concrete action it remains merely an idea. '家鄉被火災' symbolizes a sudden catastrophe, reminding that future loss may arise from neglect. '憂危三五度' shows that the situation keeps fluctuating, sorrow and danger repeating. '由損斷頭財' points out that both life and property are equally vulnerable, requiring cautious prevention. Overall, the verse urges practical action to avoid disaster and loss caused by mere imagination. This fortune reminds the reader to assess risk before acting and നടത്തിയ 　to replace idle talk with tangible steps, thus safeguarding oneself and loved ones.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、未実行の願望と予期せぬ災害が結びつき、連続した不幸と大きな損失を招くことを警告するものです。『望用方心腹』は、願いがあっても具体的な行動を起こさなければただの想像に留まることを示しています。『家鄉被火災』は突発的な災害を象徴し、無視や怠慢から生じる損失を思い起こさせます。『憂危三五度』は状況が絶えず変動し、悲しみや危険が繰り返されることを示します。『由損斷頭財』は、生命と財産が同等に失われやすいことを指し、慎重に対策を取る必要があると警告します。全体として、詩は実践的な行動を促し、空想だけで災害や損失を招かないようにと訴えています。この占いは、行動前にリスクを評価し、空談を実際の行動に置き換えることで自身と愛する人を守るよう促します。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a caution that unacted desire, coupled with unforeseen disaster, can lead to repeated misfortunes and significant losses. The verses weave together images of a heart’s longing, a hometown engulfed in flames, recurrent dangers, and the potential severance of both life and wealth. Together, they convey that wishfulness alone is insufficient; proactive and careful measures are required to safeguard one’s wellbeing and assets.\n\n1. Health: Health and physical well‑being may be compromised if one neglects preventive actions. The poem’s repeated reference to danger and loss signals that accidents, illness, or lifestyle pitfalls can arise from inattention or complacency. By practicing regular self‑care, maintaining a balanced diet, and staying alert to early signs of distress, one can significantly reduce the risk of these adverse events.\n\n2. Love: In matters of affection, the verses suggest that unresolved anxieties may intensify over time, potentially eroding trust and intimacy. If concerns are merely held in the heart rather than addressed openly, partners may feel disconnected or resentful. Cultivating honest dialogue and mutual reassurance can preclude emotional estrangement and foster enduring love.\n\n3. Career: Professional pursuits may stall when aspirations remain confined to wishful thinking without concrete execution. The imagery of repeated peril underscores the likelihood of unforeseen setbacks, such as project failures or workplace accidents, derailing progress. By formulating clear milestones, seeking continuous learning, and acting decisively, one can navigate these obstacles and sustain momentum.\n\n4. Wealth: Financial security is imperiled by the poem’s allusion to the severance of both life and material assets. Sudden catastrophes, like a fire, can annihilate property, insurance coverage, or investment portfolios. Therefore, prudent diversification, emergency reserves, and comprehensive insurance coverage are indispensable safeguards against such abrupt losses.\n\n5. Family: Family cohesion is at risk when underlying tensions are ignored, as the poem implies through the symbolic devastation of a hometown. Collective preparedness, shared responsibilities, and open communication within the household can transform potential crises into opportunities for bonding and resilience, thereby preserving domestic harmony.\n\n6. Social: Reputation and social capital may suffer if one’s conduct is delayed or perceived as negligent. The poem hints that repeated misfortunes can accumulate a negative perception among peers and community. By demonstrating accountability, prompt responsiveness, and consistent integrity, individuals can maintain trust and respect in their social circles.",
