    "zh": "這首詩的主題是雷聲轟鳴、孤寂女子、文件錯亂與無意間遭遇不幸。全句以雷雲暗影為背景，突顯突如其來的危險與內心的恐懼；佳人獨掩門象徵內心的封閉與孤立，提醒人們須保持警惕；交加文書上則揭示事業、契約方面易受誤判或訴訟之風險；無事也遭迍的結尾則說明，外在看似無事時，潛在的險境仍在。整首詩以簡短四句呈現，語言凝練而含蓄，提醒人在逆境中保持清醒與謹慎，防止因自信過度而導致不幸。尤其在面臨重大決策時，詩中提醒勿因光環自誇，忽視實際風險；同時也告訴人們在處理法律文件時需仔細審查，避免不必要的糾紛。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the thunderous roar, the solitary woman, the chaotic documents, and the inadvertent misfortune. The whole verse uses the backdrop of thunder and dark clouds, highlighting sudden danger and inner fear; the woman closing the door alone symbolizes inner isolation and cautions vigilance; the chaotic documents reveal risks of misjudgment or litigation in career and contracts; the ending 'though nothing, still misfortune' indicates that even when things seem calm, hidden dangers persist. The poem, in concise four lines, uses compact language that is suggestive, reminding people to stay alert and cautious in adversity, preventing misfortune caused by overconfidence.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは雷鳴、孤独な女性、混乱した書類、そして不注意な不幸です。全体は雷雲の暗い背景を使い、突然の危険と内面的恐怖を際立たせます。女性が一人で扉を閉める様子は内面の孤立を象徴し、警戒を促します。混乱した書類は、事業や契約における誤判や訴訟のリスクを示し、結末の「何もないのに不幸が訪れる」は、事が穏やかに見えても潜在的な危険があることを示します。詩は短い四行で、凝縮された言葉で示唆的に警告し、逆境で警戒と慎重さを保つよう促し、自信過剰による不幸を防ぎます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a warning that unseen turmoil can accompany apparent calm, and that overconfidence in one’s abilities or in the safety of circumstances may invite calamity. The four lines weave the imagery of thunder and darkness, a lone woman closing a door, chaotic paperwork, and the paradox of ‘nothing yet calamity’. This juxtaposition suggests that danger is not only external but also internal, lurking in misjudgment, lack of communication, and fragile agreements.\n\n1. Health\nThe thunderstorm motif signals sudden physical or mental shock, reminding the seeker to monitor their wellbeing. Minor health issues may flare unexpectedly, urging regular check‑ups and stress management. Being vigilant can prevent minor symptoms from escalating into serious conditions.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe solitary woman at the door illustrates isolation and unspoken barriers. The poem warns that neglecting open communication or assuming a relationship is secure can lead to conflict. Attention to emotional honesty and mutual openness is advised.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nThe chaotic documents highlight errors in contracts or project planning. Ambitious actions taken without due diligence can lead to disputes or failure. Careful review of agreements and realistic risk assessment are essential.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial decisions made in haste, represented by the lightning’s sudden strike, may bring sudden losses. The poem suggests that prudent saving, diversified investments, and avoiding impulsive spending will safeguard one’s resources.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe lone figure behind a closed door points to a fragile family dynamic. Misunderstandings or neglect can fracture familial bonds. The verses encourage maintaining communication and nurturing trust to keep harmony intact.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe final paradox, ‘though nothing, misfortune still occurs’, reminds that public perception can shift unexpectedly. Reputation may be damaged by unintentional actions or rumors. A careful, transparent approach in social dealings protects one’s standing.",
