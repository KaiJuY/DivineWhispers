The overall meaning is: do not fear hardship, uphold your初心, and ultimately achieve your wishes and long‑term blessings in favorable winds.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、志気と勤勉を核にして、福運がまだ訪れていない時でも、目標を固め、学び続け、機会が成熟するまで待ち、風を借りて成功と安寧へ進むということです。『志気勤修業』は目標を定め、継続的に学習するよう促し、『祿位未造逢』は福祿は遅くても必ず訪れると警告します。『若聞金雞語』は夜明け前の待機と期待を象徴し、『乗船得便風』は機会が来たときにその勢いを利用して順調に前進できることを示しています。全体としては、困難を恐れず初心を守り、最終的に風が吹く時に願いを実現し、長期的な福を得るという意味です。",
