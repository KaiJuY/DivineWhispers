    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對未來運勢的隱喻與提示。前兩句描繪人處於追求利益的道路上，雖有目標卻被種種障礙分隔，如同『見祿隔前溪』表面可見收益，但實際上仍需跨越阻礙；『勞心休更迷』則提醒情緒與心智的混亂。隨後的兩句則轉為積極面向，『一朝逢好渡』象徵機會來臨時，能順利渡過難關；最後的『鸞鳳入雲飛』以神話生靈為象徵，寓意最終得以飛升或獲得高位。整體來看，詩歌傳遞的是：即使現況看似困難，只要保持平和之心，堅持不懈，終將迎來轉機與成功。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a metaphor and guidance for future fortunes. The first two lines depict a person on a path to gain rewards; although a goal is visible, obstacles like \"seeing the salary separated by a front stream\" suggest that benefits are still behind a barrier, and \"to labor and rest, yet become more confused\" warns of emotional and mental turmoil. The next two lines turn to a positive outlook: \"suddenly meeting a good crossing\" symbolizes that when opportunity arrives, one can successfully cross the difficulty; the final \"phoenix entering cloud flight\" uses mythical imagery to mean ultimate ascension or attainment of a high position. Overall, the poem conveys that despite current hardships, maintaining a calm mind and persevering will eventually bring transformation and success.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、未来の運勢に対する比喩と指針です。最初の二行は、報酬を追求する道にある人を描き、目標は見えるものの、『前川で給与を見ても隔てられた』というように障害が利益を阻むことを示し、『労心を休めて更に迷う』は感情と精神の混乱を警告します。次の二行は前向きな展望へと変わり、『一朝好渡に遭遇』は機会が訪れたときに難関を乗り越えられることを象徴し、最後の『鳴凰が雲中へ飛ぶ』は神話的な生物を用いて最終的な昇華や高い地位の取得を意味します。全体として、詩は現在の困難にもかかわらず、冷静な心を保ち、粘り強くあればやがて変化と成功が訪れると伝えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that one’s current journey toward prosperity may appear obstructed, yet perseverance and a calm mindset can eventually transform obstacles into opportunities for growth and advancement. The verses use natural imagery—seeing a reward separated by a stream and the confusion of labor—to symbolize external barriers and internal doubts, while the arrival of a favorable crossing and the mythical phoenix ascending to the clouds represent moments of breakthrough and eventual elevation.\n\n1. Health: The line about laboring yet becoming more confused signals mental fatigue; it advises rest and mindful attention to one’s well‑being. When a “good crossing” appears, it suggests an opportunity to seek medical advice or engage in healthy practices, potentially leading to better outcomes.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The separation depicted by the stream indicates communication gaps. Embracing the chance to “cross” implies open dialogue, fostering mutual understanding and strengthening bonds.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The poem’s focus on unseen rewards emphasizes persistence. By staying patient, one may eventually secure promotions or new opportunities, as symbolized by the phoenix’s ascent.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Initial doubts about receiving benefits mirror financial uncertainty. When circumstances shift—akin to encountering a favorable crossing—there is potential for increased earnings or wise investments.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The narrative of obstacles causing confusion reflects family discord. Maintaining a calm, steady approach may help reconcile differences, leading to harmony similar to the poem’s resolution.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The mythical phoenix signals recognition and influence. By navigating challenges with resilience, one can earn respect and expand social networks, ultimately achieving a respected status.\n\nOverall, the poem encourages viewers to accept present hardships as temporary, to practice patience, and to remain hopeful, for such qualities are often rewarded with progress and eventual success.",
