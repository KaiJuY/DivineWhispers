    "zh": "這首詩的主題是孤舟在急流中試圖渡岸，暗示人生面臨風浪與孤立時的無助與渴望。詩中描述孤舟欲過岸，象徵行者渴望突破困境；浪急渡人空，波濤洶湧卻空留孤舟，表現逆境中缺乏援助的無奈；女人立流水，則呈現柔弱卻堅毅於危急境地的形象；望月意情濃，抒發內心對月光與寧靜的嚮往，亦象徵對美好情感的渴求。整體而言，詩以水為背景，寓意人生的流動與變化，提醒讀者在逆境中保持堅定與審慎，並珍惜身邊關係與內在情感。此外，詩中以「月」為象徵，既是寧靜的照耀，也是遠方的指引，勸人勿因短暫的波折而失去對未來的信念。孤舟與流水的對比，更凸顯個體在浩瀚大河中尋求自我定位的奮鬥。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the solitary boat striving to cross a swift current, symbolizing the helplessness and longing one feels when confronting life's storms and isolation. In the poem, the solitary boat's desire to reach the opposite shore symbolizes a wanderer's yearning to break through adversity; the urgent waves and empty crossing depict turbulent tides leaving the lone vessel adrift, reflecting the helplessness of lacking assistance in hardship; the woman standing in the flowing water portrays a fragile yet steadfast figure amid danger; gazing at the moon, her deep feelings express a yearning for the serenity and beauty of affection. Overall, the poem uses water as a backdrop, implying the fluidity and change inherent in life, urging readers to remain resolute and cautious amid adversity while cherishing close relationships and inner emotions. Moreover, the moon serves as a symbol in the poem, both a tranquil light and a distant guide, reminding one not to lose faith in the future due to brief setbacks. The contrast between the boat and the flowing water further accentuates the individual's struggle to find self‑positioning in a vast river.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、急流を越え Tahoeようとする孤舟であり、人生の嵐と孤立に直面した際に感じる無力感と渇望を象徴している。詩では、孤舟が対岸へと渡ろうとする様子が旅人の困難を打破したいという切望を象徴し、波の急流と空っぽの渡り道は荒波に揺れ漂う孤立した船を描き、援助の欠如した無力さを示す。女性が流れの中に立つ姿は、危険な中で頑張る弱さと堅忍の姿を示し、月を眺める彼女の深い感情は、静寂と美しい愛情への切望を表す。全体として、詩は水を背景に用い、人生の流動と変化を暗示し、逆境に直面しても決意と慎重さを保ち、近しい人間関係や内なる感情を大切にするよう読者に促す。さらに、詩の中で月は象徴として機能し、静寂の光であると同時に遠方の導き手であり、短い障害で将来への信念を失わないように警告する。孤舟と流水の対比は、広大な川の中で自己の位置を求める個人の闘いをさらに強調する。",
