    "zh": "这首诗的主题是以道合为核心，强调行为与道理的统一，从而实现心所欲之财富与内心平和。诗中先指出若遵循“道合须成合”，行动与内在准则相符，事事皆能顺利完成；但初期仍会遇到忧虑与烦恼，提示人们须坚持并正视挑战；随后“所求财宝盛”表明欲望得以实现，财运随之涌现；最后“更变得中和”暗示在经历波折后，内心与外在将达成和谐，幸福将随之而来。整体以“道合”作为贯穿线索，提示人们通过内省与道德修养，才能在物质与精神上得到双重满足。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is that the core idea centers on the principle of '道合'—the alignment of actions with the Dao—to achieve the fulfillment of one's desires and inner harmony. The first line, '道合须成合,' indicates that when one's conduct is consistent with moral principles, everything proceeds smoothly. Yet the second line reminds us that the initial stage will still bring worries and troubles, urging perseverance and confronting challenges. The third line, '所求财宝盛,' suggests that the sought-after wealth will indeed materialize, bringing prosperity. Finally, '更变得中和' conveys that after enduring turmoil, both inner and outer realms will attain balance, leading to happiness. The poem ties these ideas together under the overarching motif of '道合,' implying that through introspection and ethical cultivation, one can attain dual satisfaction in both material and spiritual realms.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは「道合」――行動と道の調和を通じて願いと内なる調和を成就することにあります。最初の行「道合須成合」は、行為が道徳的原則と一致すると事が円滑に進むことを示します。しかし二番目の行は、初期段階で心配や困難が続くことを示し、忍耐と挑戦への直面を促します。三番目の行「所求財宝盛」は、求める富が実現し繁栄をもたらすことを示唆します。最後の「更変得中和」は、試練を乗り越えた後に内外が調和し、幸福へと至ることを示します。全体として「道合」を軸にし、内省と倫理修養を通じて物質的・精神的両面での満足を得ることを示唆しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that alignment between one's actions and the guiding principle—referred to as '道合'—creates a harmonious trajectory toward both material prosperity and inner balance. The first line asserts that when behavior conforms to the Dao, obstacles diminish and success naturally follows. Yet the poem acknowledges that the initial phase will be fraught with anxieties and challenges, urging perseverance and a calm acceptance of hardship. The third line confirms that desires for wealth will be met, illustrating the fruition of effort. Finally, the concluding line speaks of transformation into equilibrium, signifying that after enduring fluctuations, one will return to a state of balance and happiness.\n\nFrom this philosophical backdrop, the poem offers insights that can be translated into everyday life.\n1. **Health** – The need to remain steady during the early hardships suggests that maintaining physical and mental resilience is vital. A balanced routine, regular rest, and attentive self‑care will allow one to weather stress without losing footing.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The idea that actions aligned with truth foster harmony implies that sincerity and consistency in relationships cultivate trust. Even when disagreements arise, staying true to one's values preserves emotional equilibrium.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The promise of material success following disciplined conduct encourages a professional ethic rooted in integrity. Ambition should be pursued with clarity of purpose, ensuring that progress is aligned with broader principles.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The poem’s affirmation that wealth will gather after consistent effort highlights prudent stewardship. Sustainable financial decisions rooted in honesty and responsibility will bring long‑term prosperity.\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The notion of '中和'—balance—extends to familial life, suggesting that equitable attention, respect, and mutual understanding foster a harmonious home. Patience during conflicts allows the family unit to realign toward peace.\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Aligning one's public conduct with the Dao builds a trustworthy reputation. By acting with authenticity and consistency, social networks become supportive, providing opportunities for collaboration and mutual growth.\n\nIn summary, the poem serves as a concise guide that intertwines moral alignment with practical outcomes, encouraging a holistic approach to life that balances external achievements with internal equilibrium.",
