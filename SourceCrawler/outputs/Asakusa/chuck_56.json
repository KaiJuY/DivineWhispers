    "en": "This poem's theme is about the intertwining of joy and sorrow in life, and how they influence one's physical, mental, and relational well‑being. The opening line, 'life brings joy and grief', points out that success and disappointment often accompany each other, urging readers to approach ups and downs with a balanced mindset. The second line, 'though young, one may grow white hair early', symbolizes premature aging caused by over‑concern, suggesting that excessive tension and anxiety drain body and spirit. The final line, 'only when a benefactor remains', conveys a turning point, indicating that even in hardship, the presence of a wise ally can lead to peace and prosperity. Overall, the poem counsels a tolerant attitude toward highs and lows, trusting that benevolent help will appear at critical moments to restore hope and serenity.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人生における喜びと悲しみが絡み合い、身体・精神・人間関係にどのように影響するかに関するものです。冒頭の「生涯喜又憂」は、成功と失望が常に伴うことを示し、読者に波折に対してバランスの取れた心構えで臨むよう促します。続く「未老先白頭」は、過度な心配が早期の白髪として現れることを象徴し、過剰な緊張や不安が心身を消耗することを暗示します。最後の「方遇貴人留」は、苦難の中で賢者の援助があれば、平和と繁栄へと導かれる転機を示します。全体として、詩は喜びと悲しみを寛容に受け止め、重要な瞬間に善意の援助が現れ、希望と安らぎを取り戻すことを勧めています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that life is a constant interplay between joy and sorrow, and that even when burdens and anxieties appear early in life, the presence of a supportive benefactor can ultimately bring relief and prosperity. The poem advises readers to maintain a balanced perspective, to accept the inevitable fluctuations of fate, and to trust that compassionate assistance will emerge when it is most needed.\n\n1. **Health** – The line about early white hair warns that chronic worry and stress can accelerate physical aging. It encourages regular self‑care and stress‑management to preserve vitality. When a benefactor arrives, it suggests a timely health intervention or support that helps restore balance.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – Joy intertwined with grief signals that relationships will have both triumphs and trials. The poem encourages open communication and emotional resilience. A supportive ally may manifest as a confidant or partner who steadies the emotional tide.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Persistent labor and concern highlight the need for perseverance in professional pursuits. The poem reminds that setbacks are part of growth and that patience can turn obstacles into achievements. A benefactor could be a mentor or patron who opens new opportunities.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The poem does not speak directly of money, but the theme of balancing joy and sorrow extends to financial stability. It implies that prudent stewardship of resources is essential, and that wise advice may prevent loss. A benefactor might provide financial guidance or investment insight.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The interplay of emotions suggests that family dynamics are similarly complex. Maintaining harmony requires acknowledging both happiness and hardship. Supportive family members or friends can help reconcile disputes and reinforce unity.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The presence of a benefactor indicates that reputation and social standing can improve through generosity and networking. The poem encourages cultivating genuine relationships that can offer protection and advancement when challenges arise.\n",
