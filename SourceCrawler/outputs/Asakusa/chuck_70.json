    "zh": "這首詩的主題是雷與火的象徵，反映了 fairy 之因身份低微或下屬疏忽而導致的不幸與失衡。雷發庭前草暗示突如其來的災禍，火向天飛則象徵因爭執而升高的衝突。心念趕財，卻因關係不順而無法實現。掩朱扉提醒須重視下屬與雇用關係，防止重蹈覆轍。整體寓意：警醒於人際關係的脆弱與外部環境的不可預測，建議從內心調整與外部防護同步進行。此外，詩中所呈現的火向天飛亦可被解讀為一種對自我欲望的擴散，提醒人們在追求利益時須守住道德與責任，避免因過度渴求而失去平衡。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the symbolism of thunder and fire, reflecting misfortune and imbalance caused by low status or negligence of subordinates. The thunder striking the grass before the courtyard suggests sudden calamity, while the fire flying toward the sky symbolizes heightened conflict arising from quarrels. The mind’s intent to chase profit, yet it cannot be realized due to discordant relationships. Covering the red door reminds one to pay attention to subordinates and employment relations, preventing repetition of disaster. Overall meaning warns of the fragility of interpersonal relations and the unpredictability of external environments, suggesting simultaneous adjustment of inner mindset and external safeguards. Additionally, the fire flying toward the sky can also be interpreted as an expansion of one’s desires, reminding people to keep moral responsibility while pursuing benefits to avoid losing balance from excessive longing.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは雷と火の象徴であり、低い地位や部下の怠慢によってもたらされる不幸と不均衡を反映しています。庭前の草を打つ雷は突如として現れる災難を示し、空へと飛び上がる炎は争いによって高まる衝突を象徴しています。財を追い求める心は、関係の不調により実現できません。朱色の扉を閉じることは、部下や雇用関係に注意し、災害の再発を防ぐように促します。全体として、人間関係の脆弱性と外部環境の予測不可能性に警鐘を鳴らし、内面の調整と外部の防護を同時に行うことを提案します。さらに、炎が空へ向かう様子は、自らの欲望が拡大する様子としても解釈でき、利益を追求する際に道徳と責任を守り、過度の欲望でバランスを失わないように注意喚起します。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that sudden calamities arising from overlooked negligence can amplify internal conflicts and derail one's pursuit of material gains. The imagery of thunder striking the courtyard grass, followed by fire soaring toward the heavens, paints a scene where external misfortunes collide with emotional turbulence. The poet urges vigilance over subordinate relationships and proper safeguarding measures, suggesting that personal aspirations must be balanced with moral responsibility and a realistic assessment of circumstances.\n\nHealth\nThe thunder and fire metaphor signals potential physical or psychological shock, reminding the seeker to monitor health conditions closely. Sudden crises can arise from overlooked stressors or neglect, prompting regular medical check‑ups and self‑care routines. Maintaining a balanced diet and adequate rest is advised to build resilience against unexpected ailments.\n\nLove and Relationships\nThe conflict depicted by the rising fire indicates tension within close bonds. Communication breakdowns or unaddressed grievances can fuel resentment. Cultivating empathy, listening attentively, and resolving disputes constructively will help preserve harmony.\n\nCareer and Ambition\nThe longing to chase rewards is thwarted by discord, illustrating that ambition unchecked by teamwork leads to failure. Align career goals with collaborative values, seek mentors, and respect workplace hierarchies to avoid repeated setbacks.\n\nWealth and Finances\nMaterial pursuits may seem attractive, yet the poem warns that neglecting relational foundations can sabotage financial plans. Invest in reliable partnerships, maintain transparent accounting, and avoid impulsive spending driven by emotional highs.\n\nFamily and Harmony\nThe admonition to guard subordinate relationships extends to family dynamics. Treat relatives with respect, address domestic issues promptly, and create shared goals to strengthen mutual support.\n\nSocial Connections and Reputation\nRelying solely on personal ambition without maintaining external safety nets damages one’s standing. Cultivate a network of trustworthy allies, uphold ethical conduct, and protect your reputation by acting with foresight.",
