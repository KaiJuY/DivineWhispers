    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對於人心中阻礙與無法達成願望之感悟。首句「累滯未能穌」表現事業或心願因多重障礙而停滯不前；第二句「求名莫遠圖」則提醒欲求名利過遠，必先自足，否則難以實現。第三句「登舟波浪急」喚醒乘風破浪之意，但同時顯示即使出發，風浪仍將難以克服。最後一句「咫尺隔天衢」形象描繪願景雖近在眼前，卻被天與地的距離分隔，暗示現實與理想之間仍存巨大差距。整首詩透過四行簡潔語句，傳遞「順利需先修身、遠見必先聚焦」的道理，勸人耐心等待機遇，以務實態度面對前行。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a reflection on obstacles and the inability to achieve desires. The first line '累滯未能穌' shows that career or wishes are halted by numerous barriers; the second line '求名莫遠圖' reminds that longing for fame or wealth is too far and without self-sufficiency it is unlikely to be realized. The third line '登舟波浪急' calls attention to setting sail but indicates that even departure faces harsh waves that cannot be overcome easily. The final line '咫尺隔天衢' vividly portrays that although the goal seems close, the distance between heaven and earth remains, implying a huge gap between reality and ideal. Through these four concise sentences, the poem conveys the lesson that 'smooth progress requires first self-cultivation, and distant vision must first be focused', urging patience to wait for opportunities and to face forward with a pragmatic attitude.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、障害と望みを実現できないことへの省察です。最初の行「累滯未能穌」は、多くの障害によりキャリアや願望が停滞していることを示しています。第二行「求名莫遠圖」は、名声や富を求める望みが遠すぎて、自分を満たさない限り実現が難しいと警告しています。第三行「登舟波浪急」は、航海を始める意志を呼びsequenceしますが、風浪に耐えることは容易ではないことも示しています。最後の行「咫尺隔天衢」は、願いが目の前にあるように見えても、天と地の間に見えない障壁が存在することを示し、現実と理想の間に大きな隔たりがあることを暗示しています。四行の簡潔な表現を通じて、詩は「順利にはまず自己の安定を得て、遠い目標はまず焦点を合わせる必要がある」という教訓を伝え、機会を待ち、実務的な姿勢で前進するよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is an admonition that immediate obstacles, whether they be internal stagnation or external turbulence, can keep even the most determined aspirations from materialising. The verses remind the seeker that true progress is conditional on first achieving inner stability, and that distant goals must be approached with a realistic focus. Only when one patiently accepts the delay, accepts the waves, and waits for a clearer horizon can the desired destination be reached.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem’s emphasis on “waves” and “stagnation” can be read as a caution to maintain physical and mental resilience. Health disruptions are likened to turbulent waters; without stability one cannot set sail toward recovery. Therefore, cultivating calm habits, regular exercise, mindful nutrition, and listening to the body’s warnings is essential for enduring the inevitable storms.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   “求名莫遠圖” warns against chasing external validation in relationships. True partnership requires self‑sufficiency and mutual grounding, rather than yearning for distant admiration or applause. Patience in nurturing bonds allows both partners to grow individually before expectations become strained, thereby fostering a lasting and authentic connection.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The lines “累滯未能穌” and “登舟波浪急” depict a career path that stalls until obstacles are addressed. Ambition should be pursued after establishing a solid foundation of skills, confidence, and strategic planning. When the path is clear, one can navigate the waves of competition and advance steadily, turning setbacks into learning opportunities.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   The metaphor of distance in “咫尺隔天衢” suggests that financial goals, while seemingly close, are separated by unseen barriers such as market volatility and personal risk tolerance. Prudence, budgeting, and long‑term planning bridge the gap between aspiration and reality. Avoid impulsive wealth‑seeking that ignores foundational stability, and instead build a resilient portfolio that can weather the waves.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Internal “stagnation” can disturb family harmony, much like a stagnant lake rots. Addressing emotional bottlenecks, communicating openly, and creating a supportive environment are required before external pressures threaten unity. Patience and deliberate effort restore balance, ensuring that family members can navigate life’s currents together.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   The poem advises against seeking fame for its own sake. Reputation built on shaky ground erodes when sudden challenges arise. Building a network on trust, consistent behaviour, and genuine service ensures resilience when the waves of public scrutiny intensify, allowing one to maintain integrity and credibility over time.",
