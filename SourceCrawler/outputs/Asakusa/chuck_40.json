    "en": "This poem's theme is the virtue of righteousness and inner serenity. The opening line “中正方成道” indicates that maintaining balance and integrity leads to success and stability; the line “姦邪恐惹愆” warns that being drawn into wicked thoughts will divert one from the righteous path and invite calamity. Next, “壺中盛妙藥” uses the metaphor of a pot of fine medicine to stress that inner goodness and wisdom, like treasured medicine, can heal anxieties when properly applied. Finally, “非久去煩煎” states that by persistently practicing mindfulness, even if there are difficulties, they can be alleviated and vanish. Overall, the poem urges cultivating inner virtue, staying true, and using one’s mental “remedy” to eliminate external troubles and misfortune. Moreover, the poem reflects the harmony between human nature and the world; by preserving inner integrity and outward benevolence, one can live calmly amidst circumstances and ultimately find a brighter path.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、中正（公正）と心の安寧である。冒頭の『中正方成道』は、心を平衡に保ち正直であることが成功と安定へと導くと示唆している。『姦邪恐惹愆』は、邪念に引き寄せられると正道から逸れ、災祟を招くことを警告している。続く『壺中盛妙藥』は、薬壺を例えに用い、内なる善と知恵が貴重な薬のように保管され、適切に利用されれば不安を癒すことを強調する。最後の『非久去煩煎』は、長期にわたる正念を続ければ、困難が消え、煩悩が解消すると述べている。全体として、詩は内面を修養し、正直に立ち、心の『薬方』で外部の苦悩と不幸を除去するよう促している。さらに、人間と自然との調和を映し出し、内面の誠実さと外面の善意を保つことで、状況に応じて安らかに生き、明るい道へと導かれると示唆している。",
