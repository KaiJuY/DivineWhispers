    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於對於目標之等待與堅持的哲理。首句「更望身前立」暗示渴望立於人生舞台，卻亦提醒不應過於急切，應在實踐中保持謙遜。第二句「何期在晚成」指明成功往往來自於時間的沉澱與長期耕耘，暗示若急於求成則難以達致。第三句「若遇重山去」比喻人生困難如重重山峰，唯有以決心跨越，方能迎接未來。最後「財祿自相迎」則說明當努力與時機相合時，財富與聲望將自然而然地到來，並非單靠祈願。整首詩以簡短語句傳遞了等待、努力與機遇並重的生活哲理，提醒人們在追求理想時，既要堅持不懈，也要懂得順其自然。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the philosophy of patience and perseverance toward goals. The opening line “更望身前立” implies a longing to stand on the stage of life, yet warns against excessive haste, encouraging humility in practice. The second line “何期在晚成” suggests that success often arrives through time's accumulation and long-term cultivation, hinting that rushing hinders achievement. The third line “若遇重山去” metaphorically portrays life's hardships as successive mountains, and only with determination can one cross them to face the future. Finally, “財祿自相迎” indicates that when effort and opportunity align, wealth and reputation naturally arrive, not merely by wish. The poem succinctly conveys that waiting, working, and seizing chance are essential in pursuing ideals, urging perseverance and respect for nature.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、目標に対する忍耐と努力の哲学です。冒頭の「更望身前立」は人生の舞台に立ちたいという願望を示す一方で、過度の焦りを戒め、実践の中で謙遜を保つよう促しています。第二句「何期在晚成」は、成功は時間の蓄積と長期の耕耘によって得られることを示し、急ぐと達成が難しくなると警告しています。第三句「若遇重山去」は人生の困難を重なる山に例え、決意を持って越えて未来へ進む必要性を示します。最後の「財祿自相迎」は、努力と機会が一致すれば、富と名誉が自然に訪れると説いています。全体として、待つこと、働く autonomous 機会をつかむことの重要性を語り、理想を追求する際に忍耐と自然の流れを尊重するよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the journey toward fulfillment is a balance of patience, perseverance, and readiness to meet circumstances; success is not merely a wish but a convergence of effort, timing, and resilience. The verses use concise imagery to convey that longing to achieve should be tempered by humility, that greatness often emerges in later stages after persistent cultivation, and that obstacles—metaphorically depicted as towering mountains—must be confronted with resolve. When effort aligns with favorable conditions, material wealth and social esteem will naturally arrive, underscoring the harmony between internal dedication and external opportunity.\n\n1. Health: The poem suggests that a measured pace and avoidance of haste are conducive to maintaining physical and mental well‑being. By staying patient and avoiding frantic actions, one reduces stress and preserves energy needed for long‑term growth.\n2. Love and Relationships: The call to persist calmly reflects the value of steady, respectful connections. Just as the poem warns against impulsive pursuits, healthy relationships thrive when partners honor mutual patience and gradual development.\n3. Career and Ambition: The “late success” motif highlights that ambition requires long‑term dedication. Professionals should focus on continuous improvement, trusting that diligent work will eventually be rewarded rather than chasing instant accolades.\n4. Wealth and Finances: The verse “財祿自相迎” indicates that financial prosperity follows when effort meets opportunity. This implies prudent saving, disciplined investment, and timing as pathways to monetary gains rather than speculative schemes.\n5. Family and Harmony: The emphasis on humble perseverance aligns with family dynamics where patience, collective perseverance, and readiness to overcome shared obstacles nurture cohesion. Families that nurture each other gradually will experience stronger bonds and collective resilience.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The poem affirms that reputation accrues organically when one’s actions and integrity coincide with circumstances. Building a reputation thus requires sustained, genuine effort and aligning one’s conduct with societal expectations over time.",
