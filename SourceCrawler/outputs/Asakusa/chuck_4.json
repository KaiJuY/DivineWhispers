    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於志向與機遇的相互作用。首句「累有興雲志」表明君子胸中懷有遠大理想，努力奮進；但隨後「君恩祿未封」暗示此時尚未得到上位者的肯定與賞識，仍處於未被正式承認的階段。第三句「若逢侯手印」則是一種機遇的象徵，若能得到高官的支持或認可，便會開啟一連串的吉事；最後一句「好事始總總」則預示此後善事與好運將陸續而至，暗含持續的積極與努力將帶來更大的收穫。整體而言，詩句提醒讀者在追求夢想的同時，應保持謙遜、靜待機遇，並且把握好每一次可能的關鍵轉機，才能讓原本的志向得到實際的回響與成就。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the interaction between aspiration and opportunity. The opening line \"累有興雲志\" indicates the subject’s lofty goals and persistent effort, while the following \"君恩祿未封\" reveals that the subject has yet to receive recognition or endorsement from higher authority, remaining unconfirmed. The third line \"若逢侯手印\" symbolizes a potential opportunity; if the subject can secure a noble patron’s support or approval, a series of favorable events will unfold. The closing line \"好事始總總\" foretells that good deeds and fortune will steadily accumulate thereafter, suggesting that continuous positivity and diligence will yield greater rewards. Overall, the poem advises that, while pursuing one’s ambitions, one should remain humble, wait for opportunity, and seize every pivotal moment so that the original aspirations can be acknowledged and realized.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、志望と機会の相互作用である。冒頭の「累有興雲志」は、人物が高い目標と粘り強い努力を抱えていることを示し、続く「君恩祿未封」は、まだ上位者からの承認や賞賛を受けていない、正式に確立されていない状態を示す。第三句の「若逢侯手印」は、機会の象徴であり、もし高官の支援や承認を得ることができれば、一連の好事が展開する。最後の句「好事始總總」は、善事と幸運が順に積み重ねられることを予示し、継続的な前向きと努力がより大きな成果をもたらすことを示唆する。全体として、詩は、夢を追い求める中で謙虚さを保ち、機会を待ち、重要な転機を掴むことで、元々の志望が認められ実現されるようにするべきだと勧めている。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the pursuit of lofty ambitions requires patience and the readiness to seize pivotal opportunities. The verse articulates that while one may possess strong aspirations, formal recognition is not yet secured, underscoring the necessity of humility and perseverance. When a favorable patron or authority appears—symbolized by the “侯手印”—the groundwork is laid for a cascade of beneficial outcomes. The final line promises that such auspicious events will accumulate, suggesting that sustained effort and mindful action can transform initial dreams into tangible achievements.\n\n1. Health: The poem encourages maintaining mental resilience, implying that perseverance in pursuit of goals contributes to overall well‑being. By staying patient amid uncertain recognition, one can reduce stress and nurture a healthy mindset.\n2. Love and Relationships: The need for “侯手印” metaphorically points to the importance of supportive relationships. Cultivating trustworthy connections can provide the encouragement needed to turn aspirations into shared successes.\n3. Career and Ambition: The central message directly addresses professional progress—aspirations exist, yet authority must be earned. It advises focusing on skill development and readiness to leverage key opportunities as they arise.\n4. Wealth and Finances: While not explicitly mentioned, the accumulation of “好事” implies that consistent positive actions may lead to financial stability. Timely investments of effort and patience can generate long‑term gains.\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem’s emphasis on collective good suggests that aligning personal ambition with family well‑being strengthens harmony. Family support may serve as the “侯手印,” enabling broader prosperity.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Recognition from higher authority is essential for reputation building. By demonstrating dedication and seizing opportunities, one can gradually solidify a respected standing within social circles.\n\nOverall, the verse serves as a reminder that ambition must be tempered with humility, patience, and strategic action. By acknowledging the need for formal endorsement and acting decisively when such support becomes available, individuals can ensure that their aspirations are not merely imagined but are realized through a steady succession of fortunate events.",
