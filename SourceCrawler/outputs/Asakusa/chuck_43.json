    "en": "This poem's theme is the depiction of the future period when honor and blessings are received through integrity and diligence. The line '月桂將相滿' (the moon‑laurel will become full) symbolises the lunar phase moving from lack to fullness, implying that good fortune is about to be completed and fate is becoming favourable. The imagery of '追鹿映山溪' (pursuing the deer reflected on the mountain stream) associates the deer with fortune, and its reflection on clear water suggests that although one has not yet attained a high position, the signs of success are hidden within. The verse '貴人乘遠箭' (a benefactor rides a distant arrow) indicates that a wise person or patron from afar will support you with a helping arrow; by following his virtuous example, you may rise to a lofty status. Finally, '好事始相宜' reminds that when wishes begin to appear, one must remain cautious and avoid arrogance, so that reputation and happiness may endure.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that one’s future will be illuminated by the convergence of virtuous effort, auspicious signs, and benevolent guidance. The moon‑laurel line signals a transition from deficiency to fullness, suggesting that a period of good fortune is on the verge of completion and that destiny is moving toward a more favorable state. The deer‑on‑the‑stream image associates the creature with reward, reflecting that although a high position has not yet been attained, the latent promise of success resides within. The benefactor‑arrow motif implies that a wise or supportive figure from afar will come to assist; by emulating such a model, one can rise to an elevated status. Finally, the exhortation to guard against hubris when hopes arise underscores the necessity of humility for sustaining reputation and happiness.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem’s emphasis on forthcoming full fortune indicates a period of improved vitality. A balanced approach to work and rest will support long‑term well‑being. Maintaining an optimistic outlook during this transition can alleviate stress and encourage healthier habits.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The benevolent benefactor’s support hints at positive connections that can nurture personal bonds. Open communication and mutual respect will strengthen existing relationships. Cultivating empathy and patience will attract kindness from others.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The imagery of rising from deficiency to fullness reflects professional advancement. Setting clear, attainable goals aligned with ethical conduct will pave the way to higher status. Networking with wise mentors can unlock hidden opportunities.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   The deer as a symbol of reward signals future financial gains. Prudent budgeting and investment decisions will secure this anticipated prosperity. Avoiding overconfidence in financial ventures will preserve long‑term security.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   The guidance to remain humble and not be prideful promotes family cohesion. Respecting elders and listening to younger voices creates a harmonious home. Regular family gatherings reinforce these values.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   The poem warns that early success should not breed arrogance; maintaining humility ensures that one’s reputation grows steadily. Public generosity and genuine gratitude will bolster social standing. Engaging in community service further solidifies a positive image.",
