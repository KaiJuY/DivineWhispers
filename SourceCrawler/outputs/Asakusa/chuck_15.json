    "en": "This poem's theme is a depiction of stagnation and loneliness, expressed through four interrelated aspects: time, illness, action, and loss. 'Years misaligned and alone' indicates that the passage of time has become scarce, with the individual enveloped in isolation and a diminishing sense of fulfillment. 'Long illness unable to recover' signifies that chronic sickness is difficult to heal, afflicting both body and spirit. 'Dangerous shore, boat not launched' symbolizes obstacles that prevent progress, with the shoreline’s peril keeping the vessel from moving forward. 'Dragon lying, lost luminous pearl' represents the loss of power and hope, as if the dragon has lost its shining gem. Together, these four lines convey a mood of halted destiny, deteriorating health, and an unclear future, urging the seeker to acknowledge personal hardships and explore avenues for improvement.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、時間、病気、行動、喪失という四つの側面を通じて、不運と孤独を描いたものです。『年乖数亦孤』は、歳月が減少し、孤立と数の減少に縛られることを示唆しています。『久病未能蘇』は、長期の病により回復が難しいこと、身体と精神がともに傷つくことを表しています。『岸危舟未発』は、危険な岸で船が進めず、行動が阻まれる様子を象徴します。『龍臥失明珠』は、力と希望を失った龍のように、光を失った珠を象徴しています。全体として、止まった運命、健康の低下、そして先の見えない不安な雰囲気を伝え、相談者に困難に直面し改善の道を探るよう促しています.",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the speaker’s life is constrained by the convergence of time, chronic illness, halted actions, and loss of hope, creating a sense of stagnation, isolation, and despair. The poem uses concise imagery—years falling apart, a boat refusing to set sail, and a dragon losing its luminous pearl—to convey the perception that each facet of existence is obstructed. This perception is not merely a personal lament; it invites the seeker to reflect on how external circumstances, health, and internal resolve intertwine to shape destiny. The poem urges a sober appraisal of present difficulties and a search for constructive pathways, hinting that the way forward may require both internal resilience and external support.\n1. Health: The lines ‘久病未能蘇’ directly reference a chronic disease that refuses to heal. It emphasizes the importance of early detection, proactive care, and persistent treatment. Maintaining regular medical check‑ups and adopting healthy habits can mitigate similar stagnation.\n2. Love and Relationships: Isolation described in ‘年乖數亦孤’ suggests emotional loneliness. Building genuine connections, seeking mutual understanding, and sharing experiences can counteract feelings of being alone. Open communication fosters emotional resilience.\n3. Career and Ambition: The image of ‘岸危舟未發’ symbolizes blocked progress and a lack of launch momentum. Assessing career goals, setting incremental objectives, and identifying potential obstacles can restore a sense of forward motion. Mentorship or professional development may help navigate uncertain waters.\n4. Wealth and Finances: Financial strain may parallel the poem’s sense of stuckness. Crafting a realistic budget, diversifying income streams, and planning for contingencies can prevent a financial ‘shore’ from becoming perilous. Seeking expert advice can clarify options.\n5. Family and Harmony: Family support might be eroded as the poem portrays loss. Engaging family members in dialogue, sharing concerns, and coordinating care can strengthen domestic harmony. Shared rituals or regular meetings can reinforce bonds.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The lost luminous pearl reflects a decline in personal reputation or self‑esteem. Rebuilding a social network, volunteering, and showcasing skills can restore visibility. Maintaining integrity and consistency builds trust over time.",
