  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is: \n- It depicts a personal quest that moves between the realms of earthly wealth and the transcendent, yet remains unfulfilled without divine guidance.\n- The white clouds symbolize transient fortune, while the distant mountain represents the lofty, often unattainable, ideals one strives toward.\n- The absence of a divine encounter underscores a sense of isolation and a longing for spiritual insight.\n- The final line evokes a melancholy emptiness, suggesting that without a guiding presence, aspirations can become hollow and sorrowful.\n- Overall, the poem invites reflection on the importance of inner direction and the risk of chasing material or lofty goals without a deeper purpose.",
