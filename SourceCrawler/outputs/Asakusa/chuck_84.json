    "en": "This poem's theme is a warning of multiple impediments and decline. The first line, \"否極方無泰,\" portrays a state where extreme hardship yields no peace, indicating blocked paths and hindered action. The second line, \"花開值晚秋,\" illustrates blossoms that open yet are swiftly wilted by a late autumn wind, symbolizing fleeting opportunities and stunted growth. The third line, \"人情不調備,\" reflects discordant human relations, mistrust, and difficult emotional exchanges. The fourth line, \"財寶鬼來偷,\" signifies that wealth may be pilfered by external forces, jeopardizing material security. Collectively, the four contrasts warn that career, interpersonal, and financial aspects may suffer setbacks and losses, urging careful navigation of present challenges.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、複数の障害と衰退を警告することです。最初の行「否極方無泰」は、極端な困難の中で平穏を得られないことを描き、道が塞がれ行動が阻まれることを示唆しています。二番目の行「花開値晚秋」は、花が咲いても遅秋の風にすぐに萎えることを象徴し、機会が儚く成長が制限されることを示します。三番目の行「人情不調備」は、対人関係が不和で相互不信があり、感情の交流がスムーズにいかないことを示しています。四番目の行「財寶鬼來偷」は、外部勢力により財産が盗まれ、物質的安全が脅かされることを意味します。全体として、四つの対照が組み合わさり、キャリア、人間関係、財務など多くの面で挫折や損失が起こる可能性を警告し、現実の困難に慎重に対処する必要性を示唆しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the bearer is currently surrounded by obstacles that hinder progress across multiple facets of life. The opening line, \"否極方無泰,\" portrays a situation where extreme adversity yields no tranquility, implying that pathways are blocked and ambitions are stalled. The second line, \"花開值晚秋,\" illustrates that even when favorable opportunities appear (the flowers blooming), they are likely to wither quickly due to harsh, late‑season circumstances, suggesting the fragility of short‑lived gains. The third line, \"人情不調備,\" signals discord among people—mutual mistrust and lack of harmony—making interpersonal interactions difficult. Finally, \"財寶鬼來偷\" warns that external forces (the metaphorical \"ghost\" of greed) may siphon away accumulated wealth, threatening material security. Together, these verses forecast a period marked by setbacks in personal, professional, and material realms, urging vigilance and careful navigation. \n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s depiction of blocked paths and harsh conditions hints at potential health vulnerabilities. The lack of calm (無泰) and the notion of a “ghost” stealing riches could be metaphorical for ailments that drain vitality. Individuals may need to be proactive in monitoring health, adopting preventive measures, and seeking timely medical advice.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe line describing discord in human emotions (人情不調備) suggests that relationships may suffer from misunderstandings or lack of trust. Partners, friends, or family might experience friction; therefore, open communication and empathy are essential to restore balance.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n\"否極方無泰\" indicates that career aspirations may face obstacles; projects may stall or promotions may be delayed. Maintaining perseverance, seeking mentorship, and reevaluating strategies can mitigate these hindrances.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nThe reference to a ghost stealing wealth (財寶鬼來偷) warns of financial losses or mismanagement. Budget monitoring, prudent investments, and safeguards against fraud become crucial during this phase.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe overall theme of conflict and loss can ripple into the family sphere, potentially causing tension and discord. Cultivating patience, shared values, and supportive environments can help preserve harmony.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nBlocked paths and negative energies may affect one’s public image and social interactions. Staying mindful of reputation, practicing integrity, and rebuilding trust are advised to prevent long‑term damage to social standing.",
