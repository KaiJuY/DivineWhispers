    "en": "This poem's theme is a depiction of the heart's fluctuations amid the intertwining of moonlight and cloud shadows. The opening line, \"Moonlit celestial script lies quiet,\" portrays a clear sky and unobstructed moon, symbolizing inner calm. Yet the following \"Clouds give birth to mist and colorful haze\" hints at clouds obscuring the view, reflecting inner confusion and unease. Next, \"Longing for a distant guest in the courtyard\" signifies nostalgia and sorrow over distant friends, weighing the mind. Finally, \"No events provoke sighs\" reveals that, though nothing has occurred, there is anxiety about the uncertain future, urging a shift in mindset for self‑regulation. Overall, the poem intertwines external scenery with internal emotions, reminding readers to find balance and release inner turbulence.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、月光と雲影が交錯する中での心境の揺れや別離の感情を描くことです。冒頭の「月照天書静」は、澄んだ空と月が邪魔のない姿を示し、内なる平穏を象徴します。しかし続く「雲生霧彩霞」は、雲が視界を遮り、心の混乱と不安を映します。次に「久想離庭客」は、離れた親友への想いと哀愁を意味し、心を沈めます。最後の「無事惹咨嗟」は、実際に何も起きていなくても、未来の不確かさへの不安を示し、心境を変えるよう促します。全体として、外部の風景と内部の感情が相互に映し合うテーマを描き、読者に静寂と動揺の間でバランスと心の解放を求めるように促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a meditation on the interplay between outer celestial imagery and inner emotional turbulence, especially the feelings of longing and uncertainty that arise when one is separated from close companions. The imagery of a clear moonlit sky juxtaposed with swirling clouds illustrates how external peace can coexist with internal confusion. The longing for a distant guest reflects the ache of distance, while the final line reminds the reader that anxiety can arise even in the absence of tangible events, urging a conscious shift in perspective. The poem thus encourages a conscious balance between calm and unrest, and the cultivation of inner resilience.\n\n1. Health: The poem’s reference to a clear sky suggests mental clarity, but the ensuing clouds signal that one’s well‑being may be threatened by anxiety. Taking time to meditate on the moon’s calm can reduce stress and improve overall vitality.\n2. Love and Relationships: The longing for a distant guest signals emotional attachment to loved ones. Maintaining open communication, even over long distances, can ease the ache of separation.\n3. Career and Ambition: The shifting clouds imply that career plans may face unforeseen obstacles. Cultivating flexibility and a calm mindset helps navigate such uncertainties.\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem does not directly mention money, yet the sense of unfulfilled desire suggests cautious spending. A clear, measured approach to finances mirrors the clarity of the moonlit sky.\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem’s sadness about parting highlights the importance of family cohesion. Regular family gatherings or virtual touchpoints can sustain harmony.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The sense that nothing tangible is happening yet anxiety lingers indicates that social reputation may suffer from perceived inactivity. Actively engaging in community or professional networks, even in subtle ways, keeps one’s standing steady.\n\nOverall, the poem urges the reader to acknowledge both calm and turbulence, to seek equilibrium, and to act deliberately in each life domain to foster lasting harmony.",
