    "en": "This poem's theme is the alleviation of prolonged hardship and the transformation of fortune. The first line, '久困漸能安', indicates that after enduring a long period of difficulty, one's mental state gradually stabilizes and circumstances improve. The second line, '雲書降印權', evokes a divine blessing that bestows favor or authority from higher powers, hinting at a shift in destiny. The third line, '殘花終結實', uses the image of a dying flower finally bearing fruit to suggest that even remnants can produce results when the time is right, symbolizing that adversity will turn into achievement. The last line, '時亨祿自遷', conveys that as time passes, blessings naturally move toward the righteous, bringing both mental tranquility and prosperity. The poem, though brief, weaves a positive energy from hardship to peace, from abstract to concrete, and from personal to societal realms, urging patience and faith toward a brighter future.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、長い苦境が徐々に緩和され、運が変わることです。最初の句『久困漸能安』は、長い苦労を経験した後、心の状態が徐々に安定し、状況が改善されることを示しています。次の句『雲書降印権』は、天からの恩恵が上位者や制度からの寛大さや権力を授けることを象徴し、運命の変化を暗示します。第三の句『残花終結実』は、残存する花が最終的に実を結ぶイメージで、破綻しても適切な時期に成果を生み出せることを示し、苦難が成果に変わることを寓意します。最後の句『時亨祿自遷』は、時間の経過とともに福祉が正しい道へと移動し、心身の安寧と繁栄をもたらすことを示しています。詩全体は、苦しみから安寧へ、抽象から具体へ、個人から社会へと進むポジティブなエネルギーを含み、忍耐と信念でより良い未来へ進むよう励ましています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that a persistent struggle gradually gives way to peace, that divine favor can bestow authority, that even remnants can bear fruit, and that time itself carries blessings toward the righteous. The four lines collectively portray a trajectory from hardship to serenity, from the intangible to the tangible, and from individual endurance to societal benefit. They serve as a reminder that patience, faith, and perseverance can turn adversity into opportunity, and that with time, prosperity and moral elevation naturally follow.\n\n1. Health\nThe imagery of '久困漸能安' reflects a state of physical or mental exhaustion that eventually calms. It suggests that enduring through illness or fatigue, one can achieve a stable equilibrium, emphasizing the importance of long‑term care and gradual recovery. Regular attention to health, combined with patience, will ultimately restore wellbeing.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe line '雲書降印權' can be read as a benevolent decree that brings partners or allies into one's life. It hints at the arrival of a supportive partner or the strengthening of existing bonds, implying that affection is rewarded when it is given with sincerity and openness. Trust and mutual respect will deepen these relationships over time.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n'殘花終結實' illustrates that even a seemingly failed endeavor can mature into tangible results. This encourages persistence in professional projects, as setbacks may eventually yield valuable achievements. Aspiring individuals should view challenges as precursors to success and persist with diligence.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nThe passage implies that fortune is not immediate but will shift toward you as time progresses. '時亨祿自遷' indicates that prosperity will gravitate toward the righteous, suggesting prudent financial decisions and ethical conduct attract wealth. Responsible budgeting and honest earnings are essential to secure long‑term prosperity.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe poem conveys a gradual restoration of harmony. The peaceful transition from hardship to serenity hints at family unity returning after strife. Maintaining open communication, empathy, and patience among relatives will rebuild trust and foster a nurturing environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nFinally, the notion that blessings '自遷' to the deserving speaks to a reputation that grows with integrity. Consistently demonstrating moral character will gradually bring respect and support from the community. Cultivating genuine relationships and maintaining transparency ensures that one's social standing improves over time.",
