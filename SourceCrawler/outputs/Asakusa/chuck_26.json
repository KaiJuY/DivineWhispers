    "zh": "這首詩的主題是將軍的聲名與實際成效之間的反差。將軍以異聲聞名，象徵其領導才華與勇氣能在遠方被仰慕；進兵萬里程則寓意軍隊遵從命令、秩序井然，顯示權威的廣泛接受。然而，爭知臨敵處卻透露出即便有名望，真正面對挑戰時仍可能缺乏實際戰力；道勝却虛名警示，光靠聲名而未付實際努力，最終所得到的勝利也可能只是名存實亡。詩句提醒人們：聲望須以實際行動佐證，否則即使名號再響也無法帶來真實的成果。 因此，若想在工作或生活中獲得真實的成就，需將個人聲譽與具體行動緊密結合，才能真正把握機會並將理想轉化為實際成果。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the contrast between a general's reputation and his actual accomplishments. The general's 'anomaly of voice' signifies his leadership talent and courage, which can be admired even from afar. The march of troops over ten thousand miles represents disciplined obedience to orders and widespread acceptance of authority. Yet the line about 'disputing who is in the enemy's position' reveals that even with fame, facing real challenges may expose a lack of practical combat power. The warning that 'victory yet hollow name' indicates that a name built only on reputation without effort can result in a win that is merely nominal. The poem reminds us that prestige must be supported by concrete actions, otherwise a great name brings no real outcome. Therefore, to achieve genuine success in work or life, one must combine personal reputation with tangible deeds, turning aspirations into real results.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、将軍の名声と実際の成果のギャップです。『将軍有異声』は、遠くからも尊敬される指導力と勇気を象徴します。『進兵萬里程』は、兵士が命令に従い、秩序を保つ姿勢を示し、権威が広く受け入れられていることを表します。しかし『爭知臨敵處』は、名声があっても実際に敵と対峙する際に戦力が不足している可能性を示唆しています。『道勝却虛名』は、名だけで実力が伴わないと、勝利も名実両立しないという警告です。詩は、名声は具体的な行動で裏付けられなければならないと告げ、名が響いても実際の成果には結びつかないことを示します。したがって、仕事や人生で真の成功を収めるためには、個人の評判と具体的な行動を結び付け、理想を実際の成果へと変えていく必要があります。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the contrast between a general’s public reputation and his real deeds illustrates the danger of valuing fame over substance. It cautions that even if one is admired from afar and commands loyalty across great distances, success achieved only through name alone may lack depth, and victory without effort can be hollow. The poem urges that true accomplishment requires aligning visible honor with tangible action, ensuring that aspirations are converted into genuine outcomes.\n\n1. Health: The poem emphasizes preparedness and vigilance, implying that maintaining one’s physical and mental well‑being is essential before confronting challenges. Just as a general must be battle‑ready, individuals should prioritize balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and mindful stress management.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The stanza’s warning against false glory suggests that sincere, honest communication builds stronger bonds than boastful displays. Trust is forged through consistent actions, not mere words, fostering deeper intimacy.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Professional growth is depicted as a journey of disciplined progress. Success requires persistent effort, skill development, and genuine contributions rather than relying solely on reputation or titles.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The line about a victory that is only nominal implies that monetary gains must be earned and managed responsibly. Accumulating wealth through honest work and prudent stewardship leads to lasting security.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Maintaining harmony within the family mirrors the poem’s call for cohesion among troops. Respect, shared responsibilities, and proactive support are the keys to a peaceful household.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The poem teaches that a name must be substantiated by deeds. Building a credible reputation involves consistent, positive actions and the willingness to act with integrity, which in turn cultivates lasting respect among peers and society at large.",
