    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、天命によって授与される富と順遂である。天の恩恵は神々の保護を象徴し、財産と地位が自然に上昇する。苦労を惜しむべきではないと戒めるが、努力は重要だが天助がなaviaれば結果は限定される。前途が顕れるという言葉は、未来の景色は過去の行いによって明らかになることを示す。長期にわたる善行と正道の遵守は、名誉と資源を継続的に高める。詩は、天意に従い、善行を行うことで最終的に高位と財宝を得ることを強調する。最後に、詩は未来に対して自信と安寧を保ち、天の助力が成功へと導くと励ます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that prosperity and advancement are gifts bestowed by divine favor, and that steadfast virtuous conduct over time is the key to securing lasting success. The poem encourages a balanced view that while effort and diligence are necessary, ultimate attainment is contingent upon alignment with higher principles.\n\n1. Health: The verses imply that with divine blessing, one’s physical well‑being will be safeguarded. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle while engaging in positive actions will reinforce this favor. Neglecting health may reduce the flow of celestial support.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: In matters of affection, the poem suggests that harmonious connections will flourish when one practices benevolence. Trust and mutual respect will lead to mutual growth. Conflict is avoided if one remains sincere and compassionate.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The poem warns that career progress is linked to consistent righteous behavior. Steady dedication and integrity will gradually open doors to higher positions. Hasty or unethical pursuits may stall advancement.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Financial prosperity is portrayed as a natural outcome of sustained good deeds. Prudence and generosity will attract abundance. Overreliance on short‑term gains may diminish long‑term wealth.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The family sphere benefits from long‑term goodwill. Patience, care, and respect for elders will strengthen familial bonds. Neglect or impatience may erode harmony over time.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Social reputation will grow with continued positive contributions. A network built on trust and altruism will attract supportive allies. Irresponsible behavior will tarnish standing and limit influence.",
