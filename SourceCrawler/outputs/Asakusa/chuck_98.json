    "zh": "這首詩的主題是描繪人在試圖解開新糾結的「絲」時，卻發現自己被無形的「網」所困，心中沾滿了無聊的憂愁，甚至影響到對對錯的辨識，最終與周遭人共同陷入悲傷的境地。詩中以絲與網的隱喻，說明了問題的複雜性與被束縛的無奈，亦暗示了人與人之間情緒的相互牽連。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the frustration of attempting to untangle new complications—symbolized by a tangled silk thread—only to find oneself caught in an unseen web. The speaker feels idle sorrow that clouds judgment of right and wrong, and shares this melancholy with others, highlighting how interconnected our sorrows can become.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、新しい糸を解きほぐそうとするものの、むしろ複雑に絡まり、目に見えない網に捕らえられ、ひとり静かに苦しみ、周囲の人々と共に悲しむという感覚を描いています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the seeker faces the difficulty of resolving newly tangled issues, represented by a disordered silk thread. The recurring motif of a net signifies the inevitable entrapment that arises from complexity, while the notion of idle sorrow suggests a passive, lingering grief that muddles the perception of right and wrong. The final line reflects the shared nature of this sorrow—how many people encounter similar pain—emphasizing the interconnectedness of individual suffering. The poem therefore serves as a contemplative reminder that even our best intentions to untangle problems can become ensnared, and that sorrow is often a communal experience rather than an isolated one.",
