    "en": "This poem's theme is about the interaction between human aspirations and the constraints of the surrounding environment. The line '仙鶴立高枝' suggests that even with lofty ambitions and auspicious symbols, one may be hindered by external limitations and unable to achieve smoothly. Next, '防他暗箭虧' points out hidden dangers lurking in the darkness, reminding us to be vigilant against unforeseen threats. Following that, '井畔剛刀利' and '戶內更防危' emphasize that risks are not limited to the outside world but also exist within the home and inner self. The poem, with its concise four lines, paints a picture of interwoven fortune and peril in daily life, urging a multifaceted inspection and proactive precaution.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人間の抱く願望と周囲の制約との相互作用に関するものです。『仙鶴立高枝』という行は、たとえ高い志や縁起の良い象徴があっても、環境の制限により順調に達成できない可能性を示唆します。続く『防他暗箭虧』は、暗闇に潜む予期せぬ危険を警戒する必要性を示しています。そして『井畔剛刀利』と『戶內更防危』は、危険が外部だけでなく、家庭内や内面にも潜んでいることを強調します。四行という簡潔な構成で、運と危険が交錯する日常を描き、複数の観点から検討し、事前に防御することを促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the seeker’s aspirations, though auspicious and lofty, may be constrained by both external obstacles and internal vulnerabilities. The imagery of a crane perched on a high branch illustrates ambition that is physically elevated yet blocked from reaching its ultimate destination. The warning of hidden arrows emphasizes the presence of unforeseen dangers that can strike from darkness, urging vigilance. The sharp knives by the well and the continuous need for protection within the household remind the reader that threats arise not only in the outside world but also inside one’s own safe haven. Together, the verses paint a balanced picture of fortune intertwined with peril, prompting the reader to adopt a cautious, all‑angles approach to safeguarding their wellbeing.\n\n1. Health\n   The lines suggest that health may be at risk from unseen causes, such as subtle illnesses that are hard to detect. Regular check‑ups and mindfulness toward subtle changes in body signals are recommended to mitigate hidden threats.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   Relationships may face hidden misunderstandings or emotional \"arrows\" that can undermine harmony. Open communication and attentiveness to subtle cues can prevent inadvertent harm.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The crane’s lofty perch reflects high aspirations that could be impeded by external constraints. It advises setting realistic goals, anticipating obstacles, and developing adaptive strategies.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Financial security can be threatened by unseen liabilities or sudden expenses, symbolized by the sharp knives by the well. Diversifying income sources and maintaining an emergency reserve are prudent measures.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   The poem warns that domestic life can harbor unseen dangers. Establishing clear boundaries, encouraging transparent dialogue, and fostering a supportive home environment can safeguard familial wellbeing.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Hidden arrows represent rumors or misunderstandings that may tarnish reputation. Consistent integrity, careful choice of associations, and proactive reputation management are essential to avoid such pitfalls.",
