    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對過去失意與未來希望的雙重反思。前兩句「舊用多成破」與「新更始見財」分別描寫舊事消散、舊困難化為新機會，暗示過往的不幸會被拋棄，新的願望將帶來財富。接續「改求雲外望」提醒人們要放眼遠大，不要僅止於眼前；最後「枯木遇春開」以枯木重獲生機作比，強調經歷困境後仍能再度綻放。整首以正面語調，勉勵人們保持信心，勇於擁抱變化與機遇。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a dual reflection on past misfortunes and future hopes. The first two lines, 'Old use often turns to ruin' and 'New begins to see wealth', portray the dissolution of former troubles and the emergence of new opportunities, suggesting that past misfortunes will be cast aside while new aspirations bring prosperity. The line 'Seek beyond the clouds' urges one to look far ahead, and the final line, 'A barren tree meets spring and blossoms', uses the image of a dead tree gaining new life to emphasize that even after hardship one can bloom again. The poem overall delivers an encouraging tone, urging readers to stay hopeful, embrace change, and seize opportunities.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、過去の不運と未来への希望という二重の反省です。最初の二行「旧用多成破」「新更始見財」は、かつての困難が解消され、新たな機会が生まれる様子を描き、過去の不運は捨て去られ、新たな願望が豊かさをもたらすことを示唆しています。『雲外望を改めて求めよ』という行は、現状にとどまらず遠くを見つめるよう促し、最後の行「枯木遇春開」は枯れ木が春に芽を出すイメージで、苦境を乗り越えれば再び咲くことができると強調しています。全体として、前向きな語調で読者に希望を保ち、変化を受け入れ、機会をつかむよう励ましています。",
