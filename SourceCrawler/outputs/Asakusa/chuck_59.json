    "zh": "這首詩的主題是心境的漂移與迷惘。開頭的「去住心無定」指出內心不定，既無定居亦無靜定；隨後的「行藏亦未寧」表現行動與停留皆未達平穩。詩中「一輪清皎潔」象徵內在光明與澄澈，卻被「黑雲乘」所遮，暗示雲覆之下的彷徨與不安。整體寓意是：若仍陷於心緒不定與外在困擾，光明之路難以照耀，需先清除雲障，重獲內心的寧靜與決斷。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the restless and bewildered state of the mind. The opening lines '去住心無定' indicate an unsettled heart, lacking both permanence and calm. Subsequently, '行藏亦未寧' shows that both movement and stillness have yet to achieve equilibrium. The verse mentions '一輪清皎潔', symbolizing inner light and clarity, yet it is shrouded by '黑雲乘', suggesting the haze of confusion and anxiety beneath. Overall, it conveys that as long as one remains trapped in indecisiveness and external turmoil, the path of illumination becomes difficult. One must first dispel the clouds to regain inner serenity and decisiveness.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、心の揺らぎと迷いである。冒頭の『去住心無定』は、不安定な心を示し、安定も静寂も欠如していることを指摘する。続く『行藏亦未寧』は、行動と静止の両方がまだ安定を達成していないことを示す。詩中の『一輪清皎潔』は、内なる光と澄みを象徴し、しかし『黒雲乘』に覆われており、混乱と不安の曇りを暗示している。全体として、もし不決と外部の混乱に囚われ続けるなら、光の道は照らしにくいという意味であり、まずは雲を晴らして内なる平穏と決断を取り戻す必要がある。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that an unsettled and cloud‑laden mind hinders the clear path forward; to regain insight and purpose one must first dispel the mental fog. The verses present a clear metaphor: a bright, pristine moon of clarity is obscured by dark clouds of confusion, and the mind itself is described as restless and lacking both permanence and calm. Thus the poem warns that indecision, uncertainty, and external turmoil block the illumination that comes from inner clarity, urging the seeker to cleanse the mind before actions can be taken with confidence.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s imagery of dark clouds over a bright moon mirrors the way mental agitation can manifest as physical discomfort or stress. By clearing the fog of doubt and achieving mental steadiness, one can reduce anxiety‑related ailments and promote overall well‑being.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – In relationships, a mind that is unsettled may misinterpret partners’ intentions or project insecurities. The guidance to dispel mental clouds suggests that clearer communication and emotional steadiness will lead to healthier, more harmonious connections.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Ambition without clear purpose feels like chasing a fleeting, obscured moon. The poem indicates that decisive focus and a calm mind are essential for setting realistic goals, executing tasks efficiently, and making strategic career moves.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Financial decisions made under uncertainty are prone to risk. The call to remove mental clouds advises careful analysis, disciplined budgeting, and long‑term planning rather than impulsive or fear‑driven spending.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Within families, unresolved emotions and misunderstandings act like dark clouds. The poem’s message to seek inner clarity can help parents, siblings, and spouses align their expectations, communicate openly, and foster a peaceful household.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – A reputation built on misunderstandings or fleeting impressions is fragile. By clarifying one’s own thoughts and intentions, as the poem recommends, a person can act authentically, gain trust, and maintain a positive standing in social networks.",
