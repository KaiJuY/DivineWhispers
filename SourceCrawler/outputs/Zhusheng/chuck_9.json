    "en": "The theme of this poem is about smooth sailing, predestined support, and natural renewal. It opens with a line of geese flying across the empty sky, symbolizing grand momentum and the soaring spirit of progress. Next it says “贵人节节逢”, meaning that at every favorable moment a patron appears, layers upon layers of help are received, and both career and fortune are aided. The barren tree in front of the courtyard then sprouts, representing rebirth after hardships, as effort finally restores vitality and brightens the path of work. Finally, “祿馬又添粧” depicts a fortunate horse adorned with ornaments, signifying that achievements grow and honor is doubled. The entire poem paints a light yet profound picture of a journey from difficulty to ease, reminding readers to seize opportunities, welcome benefactors, and continually elevate themselves. The poem also reminds us that just as geese need wind to glide, careers need good chances and support; only when the wind is favorable can the barren tree sprout and the horse be ornamented, leading to a truly prosperous era.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、順風満帆であること、因縁の相互作用、自然な再生を描いています。詩は空の虚無に雁が行列を成す光景から始まり、広大な勢いと進歩の精神を象徴します。続く『貴人節節逢』は、好機が訪れるたびに貴人が現れ、何層もの支援が受け、仕事と運勢の両方が助けられることを意味します。庭前の枯れた木が芽を出す描写は、苦境を乗り越えて努力がやがて生気を取り戻し、職業の道を明るくする様子を表しています。最後に『祿馬又添粧』は、幸運の馬が装飾を添えられ、功績が増大し栄光が二倍になることを示しています。全体として、苦難から順調へと進む旅を軽やかに、かつ深く描き、読者に機会を掴み、恩人を歓迎し、自己を高め続けるよう促しています。詩は、雁が風に乗って飛ぶように、事業も良いチャンスと支援が必要であることを思い起こさせ、風が順調なときにのみ枯れ木が芽を出し、馬が装飾され、真の繁栄の時代が訪れると述べています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that fortunes rise in waves when one aligns with supportive forces and renews oneself. The first image of a flock of geese cutting across the sky symbolizes momentum and a collective forward motion that carries one beyond ordinary limits. The line “貴人節節逢” underscores that successive favorable moments are accompanied by benevolent patrons, each layer of aid compounding the progress in career and wealth. The barren tree sprouting in the courtyard marks a revival after hardships; it shows that perseverance can transform stagnation into blossoming opportunity. Finally, the embellished “祿馬” signifies that success, when nurtured, becomes radiant and multiplied, bringing honor and recognition. Together, these images form a narrative of transformation—from struggle to flourishing—emphasizing that timing, support, and personal effort are all essential.\n\nInsights in specific areas:\n\n1. Health\n   The poem’s reference to natural renewal suggests that health can be restored through patience and supportive care. Just as the tree regrows after drought, one’s body can recover with proper rest and nutrition. Maintaining a positive mindset also promotes resilience, mirroring the geese’s steady flight.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The recurring patronage in the poem implies that nurturing relationships can bring repeated blessings. A supportive partner or friend can act as a “貴人”, offering guidance at pivotal moments. Mutual encouragement strengthens bonds, leading to harmonious growth.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The flock of geese and the supportive patrons together illustrate that progress requires momentum and external support. Setting clear goals, seeking mentors, and staying adaptable will help one ride the favorable winds toward success. Consistency, like the repeated encounters with benefactors, builds momentum over time.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   The blooming tree and the ornate horse serve as metaphors for wealth that is cultivated and celebrated. Financial gains should be viewed as rewards for perseverance; investments in education or skill development often yield the “added ornaments” that elevate one’s financial standing.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   The poem encourages viewing challenges asanele\n   Opportunities to grow. When hardships arise, the family can come together to support each other, just as the trees sprout new life after adversity. This perspective helps families navigate conflicts and strengthen bonds.\n\n6. Societal Development\n   The poem’s message of relying on external assistance, seeking allies, and taking advantage of opportunities for personal growth resonates with the concept of social networks. A successful society is built on cooperation, support, and shared resources.\n\nThe poem reminds us that just as geese need wind to glide, careers need good chances and support; only when the wind is favorable can the barren tree sprout and the horse be ornamented, leading to a truly prosperous era.",
