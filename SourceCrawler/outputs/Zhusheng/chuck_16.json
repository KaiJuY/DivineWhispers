Overall, the verse advises vigilance in adversity, continuously adjusting course to avoid danger and reach a safe harbor.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、鉄船が江海を渡る際に風浪に直面し、人生の旅路で直面する困難と危険を象徴しています。「鉄船」は堅固で勇敢な精神を、そして「風浪」は突発的な変化と試練を表します。船が「陰崖」に近づくと、上を向くと「三台」が見えることで、健康、財政、対人関係という三つの危険要因を示唆します。全体として、詩は困境で警戒を保ち、航路を調整し続けることで危険を回避し、安全な港へ到達できると警告しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the iron boat’s voyage across turbulent waters serves as a metaphor for life’s unpredictable trials. The sudden wind and waves, the looming shadow cliff, and the three visible platforms together illustrate how health, finances, and relationships can simultaneously threaten one’s journey, yet awareness and adaptability can steer one toward safety.\n\n1. Health\n   The three platforms behind the cliff symbolize imminent health risks; staying vigilant and proactively managing one’s well‑being is essential. Regular check‑ups and a balanced lifestyle can mitigate these hazards and ensure smoother progress.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The stormy waters reflect turbulent emotions and misunderstandings in close bonds. By maintaining open communication and empathy, one can navigate these currents and preserve harmony.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   The iron boat’s steadfastness represents dedication to goals; yet the unpredictable waves remind us that unforeseen obstacles may derail plans. Flexibility and continuous skill development enable one to adjust course and sustain momentum.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Financial instability is likened to the sudden surge of waves; prudent budgeting and diversified investments can prevent costly setbacks. Being prepared for market fluctuations safeguards long‑term prosperity.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   The shadow cliff warns of hidden domestic tensions; confronting issues honestly fosters unity. Regular family rituals and shared responsibilities reinforce a supportive environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   The poem’s cautionary tone underscores that reputation is fragile like the boat’s hull. Actively building trust and demonstrating integrity ensures that social ties remain resilient against external challenges.",
