    "en": "This poem's theme is vividly depicting the cycle of war and peace through striking imagery. The poem first presents 'Red flames fill the sky with heat', projecting the battlefield's blaze across the heavens, emphasizing the ferocity and endless turbulence. 'The weapons are renewed daily' explains that warfare continuously updates, with conflicts emerging incessantly. Then, 'If the dragon and tiger move', invoking the heroic spirit of ancient generals, suggests that if someone acts within this realm, it will trigger greater upheavals; finally 'Afterward we see peace', offers a turning point, indicating that after enduring turmoil, the light of peace will eventually shine. The poem’s message reminds us that, although worldly affairs may resemble ceaseless fire, if one steadfastly upholds the ideals of peace, the storm will pass and serenity will arrive.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、鮮やかなイメージで戦争と平和の輪廻を描いています。詩はまず『紅火満天炎』で、戦場の炎を天に投影し、激しさと終わらない動揺を強調します。次に『干戈日日新』で、戦争が日々更新され、衝突が絶えず生まれることを示します。続いて『若逢龍虎動』で、龍虎の戦いを呼び起こし、古代の武将の勇気を暗示。最後に『過了見太平』で、戦乱を経て平和の光がやがて照らすことを示します。詩は、世の中が炎のように続いていても、平和の理念を守り続ければ、嵐が過ぎ去り、静けさが訪れるという教えを伝えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the world is caught in an endless cycle of conflict and renewal, yet through perseverance and the aspiration for harmony, a period of tranquility inevitably follows. The vivid depiction of red flames across the sky and the daily renewal of weapons illustrate the intensity and constancy of turmoil. By invoking the imagery of dragons and tigers—symbols of power and courage—the poem reminds the reader that those who engage in the crucible of conflict must do so with resolve, but it also foreshadows that such struggle will ultimately give way to peace. The concluding line, “Afterward we see peace,” provides hope, emphasizing that suffering is temporary and that a stable, calm future is attainable when one remains steadfast toward reconciliation.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem underscores the importance of enduring hardship and maintaining inner fortitude. Just as the battlefield’s fire can be overcome, a person’s health challenges may persist, but with determination and proper care, recovery and stability will arrive.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   Conflict within relationships can mirror the poem’s warfare, yet it also signals growth. Couples or friends who navigate disagreements with patience and respect can transform tension into stronger bonds, ultimately fostering mutual peace.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Professional life often involves competition and changing environments, akin to the “weapons renewed daily.” Recognizing this dynamism encourages adaptability; perseverance amid challenges can lead to rewarding achievements and a harmonious workplace.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Economic fluctuations resemble the poem’s cycle of war and peace. By managing resources wisely and preparing for downturns, one can navigate financial turbulence, eventually reaping stability and prosperity.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Family disputes may arise like the dragon‑tiger confrontation. Resolving them with understanding and patience restores balance, ensuring that the household ultimately enjoys peace and cohesion.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Public controversies or rumors can ignite a storm of discord. Maintaining integrity and engaging constructively with the community can mitigate backlash, allowing the individual’s reputation to heal and flourish over time.",
