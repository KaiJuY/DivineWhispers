  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a concise reminder that future success depends on foresight, harmonious progress, and timely action. The opening line \"參拾增一枝\" employs numerical symbolism to suggest continuous growth, whether in career or relationships. The second line \"未來我先知\" emphasizes personal agency and the importance of clear thinking when confronting uncertainty. The third line \"萬事皆合意\" indicates that all matters can proceed smoothly, implying that well‑planned intentions will materialise. The final line \"添油正合宜\" translates into a practical metaphor: adding oil at the right moment enhances the outcome, mirroring how thoughtful investment in work and life yields better results. Overall, the verse conveys that prosperity is not chance but the product of deliberate preparation and action.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s assurance of harmonious progress suggests maintaining physical well‑being is essential for sustained growth. By treating health as a foundational branch, one can avoid setbacks that would otherwise impede future prospects. Consistent care and balanced routines are implied as key to staying in sync with life’s natural rhythm.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe imagery of increasing branches highlights expanding connections and the value of nurturing them. Clear foresight in emotional situations will lead to smoother, more fulfilling interactions. The verse encourages mindful engagement, ensuring that relationships thrive as part of a balanced life.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nContinuous growth is mirrored in professional ambitions. The call to act with clear vision reinforces the importance of setting achievable goals and pursuing them steadily. Strategic planning and timely effort, as suggested by the oil metaphor, will optimise career outcomes.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nThe promise of \"萬事皆合意\" implies financial stability will follow disciplined practices. Like adding oil to a dish, careful budgeting and timely investments enhance monetary prosperity. The poem underscores that financial success emerges from deliberate, well‑timed actions rather than random luck.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nHarmony is central to the poem’s tone. Family dynamics should be approached with foresight and balanced attention, ensuring each member’s needs are met. The metaphor of appropriate oil usage serves as a reminder that the right amount of effort sustains familial unity.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe verse encourages a proactive stance in building social networks. By being aware of opportunities and responding with clear intention, one can cultivate a strong reputation. Maintaining equilibrium—neither over‑exerting nor neglecting relationships—will solidify social standing and support future endeavours.",
