    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於個人境遇的多面向預示。詩中以問病定無憂、爭訟有官箴等語句，暗示健康與法律運勢均呈穩定之勢。第二句所提及的「萬古澄淡月」象徵持續不變的平和與寧靜，為人生帶來穩定的基礎。最後一句「昨夜客回首」則透露過去的關係或舊日的情感已結束，意味著離別與新的開始。整首詩雖簡短，卻將身心健康、法務風險、內在平和與人際關係三大領域緊密相連，並以月亮的永恆象徵為橋樑，提醒讀者保持平和心態、謹慎行事，並對未來的變化保持開放與接受的心境。\n",

The lines ask about health to assure peace, and mention judicial guidance, indicating stability in both wellbeing and legal matters. The phrase \"eternal clear moon\" symbolizes enduring calmness, providing a stable foundation for life. Finally, \"last night's guest turned back\" hints that past relationships or emotions have concluded, suggesting farewell and new beginnings. Though brief, the poem intertwines health, legal risk, inner tranquility, and interpersonal dynamics, using the moon as a bridge to remind readers to maintain a calm mindset, act prudently, and keep an open, receptive attitude toward future changes.\n",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、個人の運勢を多面的に示すものです。\"問病定無憂\"と\"爭訟有官箴\"の句は、健康と法務の安定を暗示しています。\"万古澄淡月\"は永続する静けさを象徴し、人生の安定した基盤を示します。最後の\"昨夜客回首\"は、過去の関係や感情が終わりを迎え、別れと新たな始まりを示唆しています。短いながらも健康、法的リスク、内なる平和、人間関係の三領域を結びつけ、月を橋として心を静め、慎重に行動し、将来の変化に開放的かつ受容的であることを促しています。\n",

The first line implies that physical well‑being will be settled, bringing relief. The second line signals that disputes will involve official guidance, suggesting that legal processes will be clear and perhaps lead to favorable outcomes. The third line’s reference to a timeless, clear moon evokes enduring peace and stability that can serve as a guiding principle. The final line indicates that an old guest has turned back, symbolizing the end of past relationships or circumstances and the beginning of new chapters.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem explicitly states that illnesses will resolve, indicating a period of improved physical condition and a reduced risk of future health problems. Maintaining a balanced lifestyle and routine medical check‑ups will support this favorable outlook.\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The closing imagery of a guest turning back implies closure of an old bond, while the calm moon suggests a peaceful transition. Couples may experience a harmonious phase, but it may also herald a new connection that is stable and reassuring.\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The mention of official admonition in legal disputes signals that career advancement may be safeguarded by clear, fair regulations. Professionals should act with integrity and adhere to established procedures to secure positive outcomes.\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Although the poem does not directly address finances, the implication of resolved disputes and a steady calm state suggests that financial matters will be free of turmoil.
