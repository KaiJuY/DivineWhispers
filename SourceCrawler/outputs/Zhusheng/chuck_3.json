    "en": "This poem's theme is to remind people to maintain inner calmness in life, staying away from unnecessary worries and fears. By stating 'Even when there is no incident, one still experiences worry,' the poem indicates that even when the outside world appears tranquil, one's mind may still become anxious over trivial matters. 'No disaster, yet fear may invade' warns that even without disaster, fear can spread. 'Encountering others brings no benefit' advises that when interactions with people are not founded on goodwill, it is difficult to gain tangible benefits. Finally, 'No need to dwell on future gains' encourages people not to be overly attached to future gains or losses, but to face situations with a peaceful attitude. Overall, the poem urges readers to practice tolerance and detachment, maintaining mental balance through action.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、生活の中で内なる平静を保ち、不要な心配や恐れを遠ざけることを人々に促すことです。「事が無くても煩わしさが生じる」と示すことで、外界が平穏に見えても、心は小さな事で不安になる可能性があると示唆しています。「災いはないが恐怖が侵入する」では、災いがなくても恐怖が広がることを警告しています。「人との出会いが利益を生まない」では、人と接する際に善意を基盤にしないと実際の利益を得にくいと勧めています。最後に「未来の得失に執着しない」では、将来の利益や損失に過度に執着せず、平和な態度で状況に臨むべきだと励ましています。全体として、詩は寛容と淡泊を実践し、行動を通じて心理的なバランスを保つよう読者に教えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a gentle admonition to maintain inner equanimity and to avoid letting trivial concerns, fear, or an over‑focused pursuit of benefit disturb one's peaceful state. By presenting scenarios where there is no overt trouble yet anxiety arises, the poem stresses that our mental landscape can be affected even in the absence of external calamities. It further teaches that interactions lacking genuine goodwill rarely bring tangible advantage, and that clinging to prospective gains can lead to unnecessary distress. The overarching message is to practice restraint, calm, and a measured approach to life’s encounters, thereby preserving a stable inner harmony. \n\n1. Health: The poem suggests that calmness and avoidance of worry reduce stress, which in turn supports cardiovascular health, immune function, and overall vitality. By cultivating a peaceful mind, one may experience fewer headaches, better sleep, and a more robust response to physical challenges.\n2. Love and Relationships: It warns that pursuing others solely for benefit can erode trust and intimacy. Relationships grounded in genuine care and mutual respect are more likely to flourish, whereas those driven by self‑interest may remain superficial or transient.\n3. Career and Ambition: The poem encourages professionals to focus on the quality of work and ethical collaboration rather than on the pursuit of titles or bonuses. A measured, patient approach can lead to sustainable progress and recognition that stems from competence rather than opportunism.\n4. Wealth and Finances: By discouraging attachment to future gains, the poem advises prudent financial planning, avoiding speculative or overly risky ventures. Managing resources with foresight and restraint can protect against unforeseen losses and maintain long‑term security.\n5. Family and Harmony: Within the family sphere, the poem emphasizes the importance of emotional equanimity and open communication. Avoiding unnecessary worry and cultivating a calm environment nurtures stronger bonds and mitigates conflict.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The advice to refrain from clinging to perceived benefits applies to social networks as well. Building relationships on trust, generosity, and authenticity enhances reputation, while a reputation built on opportunism may ultimately erode social capital.\n\nOverall, the poem invites a mindful, balanced life where inner peace is prioritized, leading to healthier, more harmonious interactions across all aspects of existence.",
