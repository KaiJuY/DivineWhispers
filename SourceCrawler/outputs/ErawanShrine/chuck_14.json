    "en": "This poem's theme is about self-reflection on cause and effect and the principle of natural order. The poem advises that one should no longer ask about the state of one's body, for whether one is healthy or ill, it is all due to past actions. As misfortune and fortune arise from prior causes, the present suffering and joy are the returns of the natural order. The verses also suggest that affection flows like a river downstream; once it has passed, it cannot be reclaimed, and only by turning back and reflecting can one understand the cause and effect. Overall, the author emphasizes that every step of life is guided by the cosmic law, and only by facing one's own conduct can one achieve inner peace and harmony. Written in a Zen tone, the poem reminds people to accept fate with tolerance and reflection when confronting illness and hardship. By reflecting on past actions, one can regain inner harmony and the power of self-adjustment.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは因果と天理に関する自己省察と受容に関するものです。詩は、体調についてもう尋ねる必要はないと告げており、健康か不健康かはすべて過去の行いによるものだと示しています。禍福は前因によって生じ、現在の苦楽は天理の還流です。詩句はまた、感情が江の水のように流れ去ることを示し、一度失ったものは取り戻せず、回顧と省察だけが因果を理解できると述べています。全体として、作者は人生のすべての一歩が天道によって導かれていると強調し、自らの行いに正面から向き合うことで内なる平和と和諧を得られると主張しています。禅の語調で書かれた詩は、病や困難に直面したとき、寛容と省察の心で運命を受け入れるように促しています。過去の行動を振り返ることで、内なる調和と自己調整の力を取り戻すことができると語られています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that every aspect of a person's life—whether physical health, emotional relationships, career ambitions, financial stability, family harmony, or social reputation—is governed by a timeless principle of cause and effect, often referred to as '天理' or natural law. The poem urges the reader to relinquish unnecessary inquiries into immediate fortunes and instead focus on reflective awareness of past actions, recognizing that misfortunes and blessings alike are the inevitable outcomes of earlier deeds. By embracing this perspective, one can cultivate inner tranquility and a balanced disposition, even in the face of illness or adversity.\n\n1. Health\nThe verses remind us that bodily ailments are not arbitrary but the manifestation of prior habits or neglect. Rather than fretting over one's current condition, one should acknowledge the patterns of care or disregard that led to the present state. Such self‑awareness encourages proactive health maintenance and a more compassionate attitude toward one's own body.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe poem likens affection to a river that, once flowed downstream, cannot be retraced. This metaphor warns that once a relationship has ended, its consequences remain and mustasterxml be accepted. It encourages introspection about one's conduct in relationships, thereby fostering more mindful and responsible interactions in the future.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nSuccess or setbacks in one’s professional life are seen as the fruits of earlier efforts and decisions. Recognizing this causal link promotes a disciplined approach to work and a realistic appraisal of progress. It also suggests that ambition should be balanced with reflection, ensuring that career choices align with deeper personal values.\n\n3. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial fortunes are portrayed as part of the same causal cycle, emphasizing that wealth accrues or dissipates due to prior choices. This perspective invites prudent financial planning and ethical conduct in handling resources, reinforcing that short‑term gains should not override long‑term stability.\n\n4. Family and Harmony\nFamily bonds, like all relationships, are subject to the law of cause and effect. The poem implies that harmony within the household is contingent upon mutual respect and thoughtful communication. By reflecting on past family interactions, individuals can work toward restoring balance and nurturing a supportive environment.\n\n5. Social Connections and Reputation\nPublic image and social standing, too, are products of previous deeds. The verses advise maintaining integrity and consistency, understanding that trust and reputation are built over time. Reflecting on how past behavior shapes others' perceptions encourages more authentic and responsible engagement within the community.",
