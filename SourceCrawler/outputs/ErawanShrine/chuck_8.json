  "rag_analysis": "Rag Analysis: The poem operates within a traditional moral framework that equates human fortune with divine decree. By employing the metaphor of 'shortcomings and poverty' (修短窮通), the poet emphasizes that individual success or failure is not a product of personal ingenuity alone but is ultimately determined by higher powers. The recurring assertion that 'all human schemes are futile unless accompanied by righteous deeds' underscores the necessity of virtue as a counterbalance to destiny. In this context, the act of praying to a deity—expressed in the line '祈禱神明消災殃'—is not a mere plea for external intervention but a ritual that reinforces the alignment between human moral conduct and divine will. The juxtaposition of faith and virtue reflects a symbiotic relationship: while faith provides a conduit for divine assistance, virtuous action manifests the faith’s efficacy. Consequently, the poem advises the listener to cultivate a disciplined mindset toward benevolence, seeking liberation from suffering and attaining serenity even amidst hardship. This exhortation extends to a broader philosophical message: the path of goodness is sustainable, offering a lasting antidote to the impermanence inherent in human experience. The poet’s use of concise language enhances the universality of the message, allowing the reader to internalize these principles without distraction. Ultimately, the poem calls upon the individual to undertake personal refinement—self‑discipline, conscious empathy, and respectful devotion—thereby confronting the mutable nature of fate while simultaneously invoking a sense of awe toward the divine. In doing it invites a harmonious integration of moral effort and spiritual reverence, guiding the seeker toward inner tranquility and a profound sense of meaning. The underlying lesson is that while one cannot control the cosmic forces that shape destiny, one can actively influence the quality of experience through virtuous conduct. Therefore, the poem serves as both a reminder of human limitation and an empowering directive to act ethically, thereby creating a feedback loop where personal virtue mitigates the caprices of fate and fosters a lasting sense of peace.",
