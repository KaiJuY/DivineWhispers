  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is:\n- The will of the heavens (天) determines success, health, and adversity.\n- Over‑thinking and elaborate plans (千謀百計) are futile when facing fate.\n- Genuine acts of kindness and the cultivation of virtue (行善修陰德) are presented as the true cure for illness and hardship.\n- The poem uses the imagery of prayer to deities and incense as symbolic gestures that mend one’s karmic debt.\n- The underlying philosophy is that inner virtue and compassionate action are the most reliable means to overcome misfortune.",
