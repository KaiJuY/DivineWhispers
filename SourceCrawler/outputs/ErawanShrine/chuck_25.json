    "en": "This poem's theme is to describe how the ritual of burning incense by relatives brings spiritual comfort and bodily serenity. The verses point out that relatives, in order to seek divine protection, come personally to worship, offering incense and offerings, thereby repaying ancestral merit. This ritual's efficacy gathers family affection and, through divine guardianship, encourages the individual to attain physical and mental balance and well‑being. The poem also reveals that only sincere offerings can receive divine attention; therefore, maintaining cultivation and good intentions in everyday life ensures lasting protection.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、親族が香を焚く宗教儀式がもたらす心の慰めと身体の安寧について説明することです。詩は、親族が神に保護を祈るために、直接崇拝に赴き、香火や供物を捧げることで、祖先の功績を返報することを指摘しています。 この儀式の効果は、家族の絆を凝縮し、霊神の庇護を借りて、個人の身体と精神を平衡と安寧へと導きます。 詩はまた、心からの供奉だけが神の注意を受けることができることを明らかにし、日常生活で修養と善意を保つことで、永続的な保護を得られると述べています。",
