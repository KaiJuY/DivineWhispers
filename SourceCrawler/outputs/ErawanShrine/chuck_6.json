  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that persistent effort combined with the correct method yields lasting success; merely multiplying labor without thoughtful strategy leads to futility. The verses emphasize patience, continuous refinement, and the importance of aligning actions with effective techniques, thereby transforming effort into skillful mastery.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem suggests that health is sustained not by frantic activity but by steady, mindful practice. Consistent, well‑aligned effort promotes physical and mental resilience, while erratic, excessive exertion can lead to burnout or injury. Maintaining a balanced routine, attentive to body signals, will foster lasting well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   In relationships, success depends on quality of interaction rather than the quantity of attempts. Persistent, patient communication—akin to the poem’s “工夫未見耐心用”—builds understanding and trust. Rather than forceful gestures, gentle, intentional actions nurture deeper connection.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Professional growth thrives on targeted skill development, not sheer workload. The poem’s message encourages continuous learning and refining techniques, leading to mastery and career stability. Regular assessment of methods and patience in execution yield sustainable advancement.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Financial prosperity is less about frantic accumulation and more about disciplined, strategic investment. By applying correct methods over time, one can create steady income streams. Avoid short‑term, high‑risk ventures that promise quick gains but often fail.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Family harmony requires consistent, thoughtful effort. The poem’s guidance on patience aligns with nurturing family bonds through regular, quality interactions. By investing time in understanding family dynamics, harmony deepens and conflicts diminish.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   Reputation is built through sustained, genuine engagement, not sporadic publicity. Persistent, respectful communication fosters trust among peers. By aligning actions with authentic values, one secures a lasting, positive social reputation.",
