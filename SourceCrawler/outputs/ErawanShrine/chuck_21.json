    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、光明と正直さ、そして内面の安寧の結合です。詩はまず、心が澄んでおり、精神が喜びに満ち、病も憂いもない人を描写し、天のような平和な状態を暗示しています。次に「光明磊落」という言葉で、正当な方法でやって来る富を表現し、福田を大切に育てれば富が自然に流れ、恩人が助けてくれるため、金銭は不足しません。「左右逢源勝神仙」というフレーズは、機会と人脈が共存し、成功への道が順調であることを示しています。最後に「作事問心無錯過、自身から得る安寧」という句は、行動は罪悪感なく行うべきであると警告し、真の安定を得る鍵であると説いています。全体として、正直と誠実で行動し、自然と人脈に調和しながら内外の調和を実現することで、永続的な幸せを得られると教えています。",
