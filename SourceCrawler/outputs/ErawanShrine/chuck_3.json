  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is:\n- The speaker is in a state of panic and confusion, symbolized by the “gold lock without a key” that cannot be opened.\n- The act of burning incense represents sincere, heartfelt supplication, which brings spiritual insight and calm.\n- Once this sincere ritual is performed, the dire situation (the lock) will eventually unlock, leading to a reversal from extreme hardship to a peaceful, prosperous state.\n- The poem emphasizes that faith and earnestness can transform adversity into opportunity, highlighting the hope that ‘否極泰來’ (from the worst to the best) will ultimately arrive.",
