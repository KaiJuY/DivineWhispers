    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、長期にわたる忍耐と突然の恩恵に関するものです。詩は、作者が渭川沿いで数年間垂釣し、風霜に身心を蝕まれ、しかし誰も慈しみを示さず、長期の努力と身体の健康への試練を示しています。後半では、賢明な王に出会い、彼の価値を認められ、運と人間関係が合わさることで安らぎを得る場面が描かれ、苦難の後、適切な人と機会に恵まれれば心配を平穏へ変えられることを示唆しています。全体として、詩は不屈の精神と見極めの眼の重要性を強調し、逆境に耐え、あの瞬間の光を待つよう読者に促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that persistent effort amid hardships can eventually attract the right recognition, leading to inner peace and external success. The narrator spends years by the Wei River, facing harsh winds and cold, feeling ignored; this illustrates endurance and the necessity of patience. Yet when a wise ruler recognizes the narrator’s value, the convergence of timing and favorable relationships brings relief. The poem thus celebrates resilience, the importance of a discerning eye, and the virtue of awaiting the opportune moment.\n\n1. Health – The imagery of enduring wind and frost signifies a long‑term struggle with physical well‑being. The poem suggests that sustained hardship can wear a person down, but the eventual encounter with supportive help can restore health and vigor. It encourages ongoing self‑care and vigilance.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – The narrator’s isolation reflects the lack of compassionate connections. When the wise ruler appears, it signals the arrival of a supportive partner or mentor. It reminds readers that meaningful relationships can provide comfort and guidance through trials.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – The poem portrays the search for purpose and recognition. The narrator’s perseverance by the river symbolizes ongoing effort in one’s vocation. The meeting with the discerning ruler indicates that competence and timing will open doors, leading to professional fulfillment.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – While the poem does not directly mention monetary gains, the sense of relief from the ruler’s recognition can be interpreted as a metaphor for financial stability. It encourages diligent work and patience, implying that prudent effort will eventually yield rewards.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – The narrative of solitude can be linked to strained family ties. The wise ruler’s acknowledgment implies reconciliation or supportive family influence. It encourages nurturing harmony through patience and openness to guidance.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The poem emphasizes the power of being seen by those who value integrity. The encounter suggests that reputation grows when genuine merit meets favorable perception. It urges maintaining honesty and building trustworthy networks for social success.",
