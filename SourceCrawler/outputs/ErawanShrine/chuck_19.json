    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於在向三面佛祈求時，真誠與供品的關聯與其對財運、健康、感情及事業的影響。詩句指出，若心不真誠，甚至缺少供品，都會影響所求之事的成效。首先在健康方面，誠意不足會阻礙身體的康復；在財運上，雖有祝願，但缺乏供品則無法完全實現財源廣進。感情亦如是，真誠與供品缺失，感情進展緩慢；事業上則必須先做好誠意與供品，才能得以順利擴展。整體而言，詩詞透過「供品」與「誠意」兩大要素，提醒求者在請神求助前必須先準備充分，方能獲得三面佛的庇佑與萬事興旺。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is... The poem emphasizes the relationship between sincerity and offerings when petitioning the Four‑Face Buddha, and how these two factors influence outcomes in fortune, health, love, and career. It states that lacking genuine intent or proper offerings can hinder the effectiveness of one's prayers. In terms of health, insufficient sincerity may obstruct bodily recovery. Regarding wealth, though blessings are sought, without proper offerings the promise of abundant income cannot be fully realized. Love faces the same issue; lack of devotion and gifts leads to slow progress. Career expansion requires prior preparation of sincerity and offerings to achieve smooth progress. Overall, the verse underscores that sincerity and offerings are essential prerequisites before seeking divine aid, ensuring the Four‑Face Buddha’s protection and success in all endeavors.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、四面仏への祈願時に真剣さと供物の関係、およびそれらが運命、健康、恋愛、キャリアに与える影響を強調することである。詩は、真剣さが不足したり適切な供物がないと、祈りの効果が妨げられると述べている。健康面では、真剣さが不足すると身体の回復が阻害される。財運に関しては、祝福を求めても、適切な供物がなければ豊かな収入の約束が完全に実現できない。恋愛も同様に、献身と贈り物が欠けていると進展が遅れる。キャリア拡大は、先に真剣さと供物を整えておくことで順調に進む。全体として、詩は真剣さと供物が神聖な援助を求める前に不可欠な前提条件であることを強調し、四面仏の保護とあらゆる事業の成功を保証する。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that genuine sincerity coupled with appropriate offerings is indispensable for invoking the blessings of the Four‑Face Buddha. The verses warn that without heartfelt intent or proper tribute, the efficacy of prayers concerning health, wealth, love, and career diminishes. This cautionary message invites seekers to prepare both inner devotion and tangible gifts before approaching the deity, thereby aligning personal effort with divine support.\n\nHealth: The poem asserts that a lack of sincerity can impede bodily recovery. It advises that one should first cultivate genuine faith and present suitable offerings to the Buddha, ensuring a harmonious environment conducive to healing. By aligning inner conviction with external tribute, the seeker creates a balanced channel for divine energy to restore vitality.\n\nLove and Relationships: In matters of affection, the text stresses that insincerity and missing gifts slow emotional progress. The guidance is to strengthen commitment and offer appropriate tokens of reverence, fostering trust and mutual understanding. When devotion is expressedANDS openly, the divine presence can ease obstacles and nurture deeper bonds.\n\nCareer and Ambition: The stanza indicates that professional expansion requires sincere intention and proper tribute. By preparing heartfelt offerings, the seeker invites guidance that removes barriers and facilitates smooth growth. The poem thus links ambition with ethical dedication, suggesting that success stems from aligning personal goals with spiritual reverence.\n\nWealth and Finances: Even though blessings are promised, the poem warns that without proper offerings the wealth’s promise may remain unfulfilled. It underscores that material prosperity is conditional upon respectful devotion. Therefore, before seeking financial gain, one should present sincere offerings to attract the Buddha’s favor and secure sustainable income.\n\nFamily and Harmony: The verses imply that a family’s well‑being depends on the collective sincerity of its members. By fostering honest intentions and sharing respectful offerings, familial harmony is enhanced. The poem teaches that the family unit must act collectively to attract the Buddha’s protective grace.\n\nSocial Connections and Reputation: The poem’s emphasis on offerings highlights the importance of respectful conduct in public life. Genuine sincerity, when combined with appropriate tribute, builds credibility and attracts positive attention. By honoring the divine, one’s reputation is safeguarded, and social relationships are strengthened, reflecting the Buddha’s blessing in communal interactions.",
