    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對自身與他人之間的分寸與專注。詩中以雪門、瓦霜作比，提醒人應把心思放在自家的事務上，勿將時間耗費在他人之瑣事。自有神明在上，暗示凡事有自然的規範與裁斷，保持距離即可。重點在於先照顧自身的健康與責任，避免因干涉外人而影響自我。若把注意力放回自身，則更能把握人生的節奏與機會，從而得到心靈與實際上的安寧與成長。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the balance and focus between oneself and others. The poem uses the imagery of snow on the gate and frost on the roof as a metaphor, urging people to concentrate their attention on their own affairs and not waste time on trivial matters of others. There is a divine presence above, suggesting that everything has its natural order and judgment; keeping distance is sufficient. The focus is on taking care of one's own health and responsibilities first, avoiding interference with others that could affect oneself. By redirecting attention to one's own life, one can better grasp the rhythm and opportunities of life, thereby achieving both inner peace and practical growth.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、自己と他者の境界と集中の重要性です。詩は雪が門に、霜が瓦にあるイメージを比喩に使い、人々に他人の些細な事に時間を費やすのではなく、自分の事務に心を集中させるよう促しています。上に神が存在し、すべてのことに自然の規範と裁きがあることを示唆し、距離を保つだけで十分です。焦点はまず自分自身の健康と責任を養うことにあり、他人を干渉して自分に影響を与えることを避けることです。自分の生活に注意を向けることで、人生のリズムと機会をよりよく掴むことができ、内面的な平和と実践的な成長を達成できます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that individuals should prioritize their own affairs and maintain proper boundaries with others. By focusing on personal responsibilities and respecting the natural order of events, one can avoid unnecessary interference and maintain harmony in life. The imagery of snow and frost suggests that true calm comes from attending to one's own matters rather than meddling in the trivial concerns of others.\n\n1. Health: Maintaining one's own health is emphasized by the poem's advice to not waste time on others' small issues. By concentrating on personal well‑being, one safeguards against stress that can arise from over‑involvement. Regular self‑care practices thus become a foundation for long‑term vitality.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The poem indicates that romantic and emotional matters are governed by higher forces and should not be forced by meddling. By refraining from intervening in others’ relationships, one respects the natural flow of affection. This approach fosters trust and allows personal bonds to strengthen without external pressure.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Professional focus is highlighted by urging attention to one's own affairs. By avoiding distractions from external concerns, one can pursue goals with clarity and dedication. Consequently, career progression becomes more stable and purposeful.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Financial stability is linked to the principle of letting events unfold naturally. The poem advises against chasing wealth through others’ situations, as it can lead to misjudgment. Focusing on personal stewardship of resources ensures prudent management and sustainable prosperity.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Family dynamics benefit when each member attends to their own responsibilities. The poem's message encourages not to involve oneself in the unrelated affairs of others within the household. This practice promotes a peaceful environment and mutual respect.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Social standing is maintained by avoiding unnecessary entanglements. By respecting boundaries, one preserves integrity and earns the admiration of peers. A reputation built on discretion and focus becomes a lasting asset in social networks.",
