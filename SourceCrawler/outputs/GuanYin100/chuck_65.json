    "zh": "這首詩的主題是以割肉成瘡的比喻提醒人們在面對風險與安危時，保持守舊、謹慎的態度更為明智。詩句先以“眼前歡喜未為歡”揭示外表的喜悅往往並非真正的喜悅，隨之出現的“危不危兮安不安”強調事態的不確定性。接著用“割肉成瘡因甚事”形象地說明，因小失大，痛苦與損失往往源於過度的冒險或不慎。最後一句“不如守舊得安全”則直言不如保持既有的穩定狀態，安全才是根本。整體上詩人通過比喻與對照，警示人們在做決定時應三思而後行，避免因衝動而造成不可逆轉的傷害。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is to use the metaphor of cutting flesh to form a wound to remind people that when facing risk and safety, adopting a conservative, cautious attitude is wiser. The lines begin with “眼前欢喜未为欢” which reveals that outward joy is often not true joy, followed by “危不危兮安不安” emphasizing the uncertainty of the situation. Next, the line “割肉成瘡因甚事” vividly illustrates that losing small things can lead to large losses, pain and damage often arise from excessive risk or carelessness. Finally, “不如守旧得安全” directly states that preserving the existing stable state is preferable, because safety is fundamental. Overall, the poet uses metaphor and contrast to warn that when making decisions one should think twice before acting, avoiding irreversible harm caused by impulse.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、肉を切って瘡を作る比喩を用いて、人々にリスクと安全を直面したとき、守旧で慎重な姿勢を取ることが賢明であることを促すことです。詩句は「眼前欢喜未为欢」で、外見上の喜びが真の喜びではないことを示し、続く「危不危兮安不安」で状況の不確実性を強調します。次に「割肉成瘡因甚事」という行で、少しの損失が大きな損失に繋がること、痛みや被害は過度のリスクや不注意から生じることを生き生きと描写します。最後に「不如守旧得安全」で、既存の安定状態を保つほうが安全であると直接述べています。全体として、詩人は比喩と対照を用いて、決断を下す際に二度考え行動すべきであると警告し、衝動による不可逆的な損傷を避けるよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a cautionary lesson that emphasizes the importance of prudence over impulsive action, using the vivid image of cutting flesh to produce a wound as a metaphor for unnecessary risk leading to lasting harm. The poet first points out that apparent joy may be illusory and that uncertainty is inherent in every situation. By describing the painful consequences of overreach, the verse ultimately advises that preserving the status quo and maintaining safety is the most sensible path.\n\n1. Health – The imagery of a physical wound suggests that reckless decisions can lead to long‑term health problems. The poem advises staying within safe limits, avoiding unnecessary exposure to danger. In practice, this means careful monitoring of physical habits and resisting sudden lifestyle changes that might cause injury.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – The line “危不危兮安不安” indicates that relationships may appear stable but can hide underlying tensions. The advice is to approach partners with caution, maintaining clear communication and not rushing into commitments that might later create conflict. This steadiness protects emotional well‑being.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – Ambitious moves that overlook risk are compared to cutting flesh for a wound. The poem encourages a measured approach to career decisions, ensuring that goals do not compromise foundational security. Professional growth should be balanced with realistic assessments of risk.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – Over‑investment or speculative ventures are metaphorically “cutting flesh.” The text recommends preserving current assets and avoiding speculative shortcuts that could lead to financial loss. A conservative investment strategy, keeping enough liquidity, aligns with the poem’s warning.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – The advice to “守旧得安全” reflects the importance of maintaining family stability. Sudden changes in family dynamics—such as moving houses or altering routines—may cause disruption. Keeping familiar patterns protects harmony and reduces stress among family members.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – Social reputation can be harmed by rash behavior that produces a “wound.” The poem stresses that maintaining old, trusted relationships rather than seeking new, uncertain ties safeguards one’s standing in the community. A steady network provides support and protects against reputational damage.",
