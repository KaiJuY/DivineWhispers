  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that one should move forward steadily like a bird perched on a rock, embracing simplicity, patience, and equitable sharing of power. The poem emphasizes that obstacles are overcome by keeping one’s body and mind pure, avoiding unnecessary desires (symbolized by the fish), and waiting for the right moment to act. It also highlights that success comes from collective effort rather than individual dominance, and that true fulfillment arises from harmonious cooperation. The overall message conveys a calm yet proactive attitude toward life, suggesting that one’s fortune is secured by balance between self‑discipline, timing, and mutual support.\n\n1. Health: The line about eating without fish suggests a minimalist diet that promotes bodily clarity. By avoiding excess and focusing on purity, one can maintain steady health and prevent disease. Regular reflection on body and mind will reinforce resilience.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: The image of a bird sharing a rock implies partnership and mutual support. Maintaining openness and patience in relationships will help avoid conflict. Timing—knowing when to act or retreat—strengthens bonds.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Steady progress, as illustrated by the bird’s steady perch, encourages gradual advancement rather than rash leaps. Aligning personal goals with shared objectives leads to collective success. Avoiding overindulgence in material pursuits keeps focus.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem warns against greed (symbolized by the fish). Managing resources prudently and waiting for favorable circumstances ensures financial stability. Cooperative ventures bring shared profits and reduce risk.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Sharing authority, as mentioned in the poem, promotes an egalitarian household. Respecting each family member’s role and acting with timing fosters harmony. A clear, pure mindset supports a peaceful domestic environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Equitable power sharing builds trust and a good reputation. Patience in social dealings prevents misunderstandings. Consistent integrity will earn long‑term respect.",
