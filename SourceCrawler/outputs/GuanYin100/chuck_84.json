    "zh": "這首詩的主題是揭示名利與德行之間的矛盾，以及行動不慎所帶來的危害。詩中指出，因名利之名而喪失德行，便會導致與他人不和，關係破碎。切忌在忙亂中匆忙改變，因急變易致凶險。更提醒人們，醉酒後行事會失去方向，難以辨明去向，若在青松影中沉睡，將陷入迷糊，難以自拔。整體而言，詩意在於警示人心應以德為根基，行事須慎重，才能避免因名利與慌亂而招致不幸。在面對誘惑時，保持冷靜與自省，方能保護自身不被外在名利所左右，維持內心的安寧與長久的道德堅持。",

    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、名声と徳の間にある対立と、軽率な行動がもたらす危険を明らかにすることです。名声のために徳を失うと、人との和が崩れます。忙しい状態で急いで変えることを避けるべきで、慌てて行動すると災いにつながります。また、酔っ払って方向を失い、松の影で眠ると混乱し、抜け出せなくなると警告しています。全体として、心は徳に根ざし、行動は慎重にすべきで、名声や慌てさが不幸を招くことを回避するべきだと示しています。誘惑に直面したら、冷静さと自己省察 Messenger を保ち、外部の名声に左右されず、内なる平和と長期的な道徳的堅持を維持することが重要です。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a cautionary reflection on the perilous relationship between public acclaim and moral integrity, emphasizing that haste and intoxication can lead to loss of direction and harmony. The verses illustrate that a reputation built on fame may erode one’s ethical foundation, fostering discord with others, while impetuous decisions in a busy state invite misfortune. They also warn that drunkenness obscures judgment, making one vulnerable to confusion and unintentional harm. In the tranquil image of sleeping beneath pine shadows, the poem suggests that even in moments of rest, a lack of mindfulness can result in a profound sense of bewilderment. Ultimately, the text urges readers to ground their actions in virtue, practice patience, and remain vigilant against external pressures that might sway their moral compass.\n\n1. Health\n- The poem’s caution against hurried actions and drunkenness implies a direct impact on physical well‑being. Avoiding intoxication and acting with deliberation reduces the risk of accidents and chronic ailments that stem from impulsive behavior. Maintaining mental calm as advised fosters resilience against stress‑related illnesses.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n- Losing virtue due to fame can fracture bonds with loved ones. The verses warn that social harmony is fragile when personal integrity is compromised. Cultivating sincerity and patience in relationships preserves trust and emotional stability.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n- Career aspirations that chase fame may undermine ethical conduct, leading to reputational damage. The poem urges measured ambition and alignment with personal values to achieve sustainable success. Sudden shifts in professional direction, as cautioned, can result in setbacks or ethical breaches.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n- The link between fame and moral erosion suggests financial ventures built on superficial acclaim are vulnerable to mismanagement. Prudence, reflected in the poem’s counsel to act carefully, safeguards against reckless spending or unethical deals. A steady, principled approach promotes long‑term financial stability.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n- Disharmony within the family arises when individuals prioritize status over character. The poem highlights the importance of a virtuous foundation to maintain familial bonds. Thoughtful decision‑making, avoiding haste, supports a peaceful domestic environment.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n- A public reputation that neglects virtue invites criticism and social isolation. The poem’s message encourages consistency between actions and values, building credibility. Vigilance against the lure of quick acclaim protects one’s standing within the broader community.",
