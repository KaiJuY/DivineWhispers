    "en": "This poem's theme is a caution against striving in adversity yet often achieving nothing. The author uses the image of 'catching the moon in water' to liken people who, in difficulty, toil earnestly but, due to improper methods or inability to grasp key points, ultimately end up empty. The first line reveals the nature of effort: although labor is spent, the moon remains unattainable; the second line emphasizes the futility of exerting oneself with no gain; the third line warns against trusting idle talk and fleeting theories, lest one's energy be squandered; the final line, 'wasting heart and effort but still unable to achieve', concludes that without changing strategy and method, no effort will bear fruit. The whole poem maintains a straightforward tone, urging readers not to be blinded by idle hopes or blind vigor, reminding them to pursue feasible paths to attain genuine accomplishments in life's complexities.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、逆境の中で奮闘しても結果が出ないことへの警告です。作者は『水中で月を捕まえる』というイメージで、困難な状況で必死に努力しても、方法が不適切で鍵を握れないため、結局何も得られない様子を例えています。第一句は努力の本質を示し、工夫を尽くしても月を得られないことを示唆。第二句は尽力しても得られない無念さを強調。第三句は浮つく世論や閑話に信頼せず、心力を浪費しないよう警告。最後の句『心力を無駄にしても成し遂げられない』で締めくくり、戦略や方法を変えなければ努力が実を結ばないと結論づけています。全体として、空想や盲目的な奮闘に惑わされず、実際に可能な道を見つけることが、複雑な人生で真の成果を得る鍵であると説いています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a sober reminder that persistent effort, when guided by misguided strategies or naïve expectations, often fails to yield tangible results. By portraying the futile act of attempting to catch a moon reflected in water, the verses illuminate the human tendency to pursue ambitions in the face of obstacles without first securing the proper means or realistic understanding. The poet cautions against taking idle gossip or fleeting theories as truth, lest one squanders precious energy. Ultimately, the piece underscores that without reassessing one’s methods and aligning them with reality, even the most earnest labor will remain unfulfilled.\n\n1. Health – The poem’s metaphor suggests that exerting oneself without clear direction can lead to exhaustion and stagnation. One should therefore manage physical energy wisely, ensuring that effort is purposeful rather than blind, and recognize when fatigue signals the need for rest or reevaluation of goals.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – In interpersonal contexts, the lesson warns against chasing affection or commitments based solely on romanticized ideas. Genuine connections require realistic expectations and thoughtful communication; otherwise, one risks investing time in unproductive pursuits.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – Professional pursuits mirroring the poem’s theme demonstrate that ambition without a solid strategy results in disappointment. It emphasizes the importance of skill development, planning, and adaptability, urging individuals to adjust tactics when initial efforts fail.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – Financial endeavors are compared to the futile chase of the moon. The poem implies that wealth accumulation demands disciplined, realistic budgeting and investment decisions rather than speculative hope. Diversification and cautious planning are key to achieving financial stability.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – Within family life, the verses serve as a reminder that striving for harmony without clear communication or shared objectives can be fruitless. It encourages open dialogue and setting attainable collective launches to sustain familial peace.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The caution extends to public perception and networking; relying on gossip or superficial praise can mislead. Building a reputation on credible achievements and authentic relationships is crucial, as transient acclaim offers little lasting value.",
