    "en": "The theme of this poem is a contemplation of human relationships and self‑cultivation. It opens with 'Small people and gentlemen should distinguish the wise from the foolish,' indicating that appearances can be deceiving, and that even good or bad people, wise or foolish, can change depending on circumstances. Next, 'In matters there are discrepancies and lies that lead to wrong judgments,' reminds us to discern truth from falsehood in disputes and avoid falling into wrongs because of misunderstandings. The line 'When a violin meets a connoisseur it should resonate like a drum' likens meeting a soulmate to unleashing potential, saying that with a good mentor or friend one can inspire oneself and achieve success. Finally, 'When conflicts are calm, one gains unexpected benefit,' points out that maintaining inner peace amid conflict can yield unforeseen advantages. Overall, the poem emphasizes self‑improvement and harmony in interactions, urging us to seek balance and progress in both relationships and inner growth.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人間関係と自己修養に関する洞察です。『小人君子別賢愚』で始まり、外見だけで判断するのは誤りであり、状況次第で善人や悪人、賢者や愚者が変わることを指摘します。続いて『事有差訛合是非』は、争いの中で真偽を見極め、言い間違いで不必要なはなのではないことを警告します。『琴遇知音当鼓鼓』は、知己に出会うと潜在力が解放されることを示し、良い師友が自らを鼓舞し、成功へと導くと語ります。最後の『爭如定静得便宜』は、衝突の中で内面を静めれば意外な利益が得られると示唆しています。全体として、この詩は自己改善と人間関係の調和を強調し、関係と内面の成長の両面でバランスと向上を求めるよう促します。",
