    "zh": "這首詩的主題是月相的循環與人事的等待。詩中以初三四五之蟾（即新月之初）作比，形容事物在開始階段仍未完整，既有半無、半有之感。作者進一步提醒，必須等待十五（即十五日即滿月）才能真正達到圓滿，亦即到處清光、到處圓的景象。整首詩強調在事物尚未完全之前，須以忍耐與等待之心來對待，類似於月亮初升後的等待，直到圓滿之時方可顯現光輝。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the cyclical nature of the moon and the patience required in life. It uses the image of the new moon on the third, fourth, or fifth day (initial waxing) to describe a situation that is not yet complete, half absent and half present. The poet reminds that one must wait until the fifteenth day, when the moon becomes full, to achieve true wholeness and see light everywhere become round. The poem stresses that before completion, one must endure with patience, as the moon ascends and waits for its full bloom to reveal its brilliance.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、月相の循環と人生に必要な忍耐です。詩は、新月の初三、四、五日に見られる蟾（カン）を用いて、まだ完全でない状態、半ば無く、半ばあるという状況を描写しています。詩人は、十五日（満月になる日）まで待つことが、真の完成と光が到来することを示唆しています。詩は、完成する前に忍耐を持って待ち続けるべきだと強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the moon’s waxing cycle symbolizes the patience required in all aspects of life. The early days of the lunar month—initially lacking but gradually gaining light—represent beginnings that are incomplete, half‑present and half‑absent. The poet urges the reader to wait until the fifteenth day, when the moon is fully illuminated, to attain true wholeness. This image of gradual illumination serves as a reminder that instant results are unlikely; instead, steady perseverance leads to eventual clarity and completion.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s depiction of the moon’s gradual brightening encourages a measured approach to health. Rather than seeking quick fixes, one should allow the body time to heal and strengthen. Consistent, moderate care—much like the steady rise of lunar light—promotes long‑term well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nIn relationships, the metaphor warns against premature conclusions. Love, like the moon, requires time to deepen and soften. By patiently nurturing affection, partners can achieve a harmonious, fully “rounded” connection.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nProfessional pursuits benefit from the poem’s call for waiting. Immediate success may be fleeting; a disciplined, long‑term strategy—mirroring the moon’s waxing—yields sustainable progress and eventual mastery.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial growth is portrayed as a gradual accumulation of light. Sudden investments may produce volatility; steady, incremental gains that build over time are likened to the moon’s steady brightening, ensuring lasting prosperity.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily dynamics are not instantly resolved; the poem’s patience message applies to nurturing bonds. By allowing each member time to grow and align, familial harmony is achieved, similar to the complete circle of a full moon.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nPublic perception is built over time. Quick acclaim can fade; steady reputation building—through consistent, reliable actions—creates enduring respect, just as the moon’s fullness is only seen after a steady rise in illumination.",
