    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對欲望與世俗話語的警醒。詩人以「欲就東兮欲就西」開頭，表達無止境的外向探索欲；「逢人說事轉痴迷」則說明與人交往往被言談牽引，失去自我；「登山不見神仙面」寓意高處求名卻未見真實靈光，顯示追求名利之路的空洞；最後「莫若歸休更勿提」提醒其放下執念，回歸沉靜，避免再被無謂欲求纏繞。詩中透出自省與淡泊的情緒，勸人勿被外物所困，應以內在平和為主，尋找真正的安寧與洞見。這種態度呼籲人們學會放下對世俗的執念，回歸內在的平衡與沉澱，才能真正理解生活的本質與自我的存在。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a warning against desires and worldly talk. The poet opens with \"欲就東兮欲就西\" to express endless outward exploration; \"逢人說事轉痴迷\" shows that conversations with others easily become obsessions, causing loss of self; \"登山不見神仙面\" suggests that climbing the mountain for fame does not reveal the true spiritual light, indicating the hollowness of chasing name and wealth; finally \"莫若歸休更勿提\" reminds one to abandon attachments, return to calmness, and avoid being entangled by meaningless cravings. The poem carries a mood of self‑reflection and detachment, urging people not to be trapped by external objects, but to keep inner peace as the main focus, to seek true serenity and insight. This attitude calls on people to let go of worldly attachments, return to inner balance and depth, so that they can truly understand the essence of life and their own existence.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは欲望と世俗的な話し事に対する警鐘です。詩人は「欲就東兮欲就西」で無限の外向き探求欲を表し、「逢人說事轉痴迷」で他者との会話が執着に変わり、自分を失う様子を示します。「登山不見神仙面」は名声を求めて山に登るが真の霊光を見いだせないことを示し、名利追求の空虚さを示唆します。最後に「莫若歸休更勿提」で執着を手放し、静寂へ戻り、無意味な欲求に絡まれないよう促します。この詩は自己省察と淡泊の感情を帯び、外部物に縛られず内なる平和を主軸にして、真の安寧と洞察を求めるよう訴えます。この姿勢は世俗的執着を手放し、内なるバランスと沈黙へと戻るよう呼びかけ、人生の本質と自己の存在を真に理解できるようにするものです。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that persistent longing for external achievements and constant engagement in social chatter distracts the individual from inner tranquility. The verses illustrate a cycle of desire, distraction, and eventual realization that withdrawal and silence offer the most effective path toward genuine insight.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem warns against the physical and mental toll of restless pursuits. Continuous striving and idle chatter can lead to stress, exhaustion, and a weakened immune response. It encourages a calm, meditative approach to restore vitality.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – It highlights how conversations can become obsessive and consume one’s attention, potentially harming intimacy. By stepping back and valuing quiet moments, partners can develop deeper understanding and emotional balance.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The line about climbing a mountain yet seeing no divine face suggests that relentless ambition may fail to produce meaningful results. Career goals should be pursued with purpose, not merely for prestige, and one must recognize when to pause.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The emptiness of chasing fame is mirrored in the pursuit of wealth without spiritual insight. Financial success is important, but it should not eclipse inner contentment or lead to greed.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – A quiet, detached stance can reduce conflict within families. By refusing to engage in needless debate, harmony is preserved, and members can focus on mutual support.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The poem suggests that excessive talk can build a false image. Authenticity and humility in social interactions foster genuine respect and long‑lasting reputation, rather than fleeting popularity.\n\nOverall, the poem promotes a balanced lifestyle that values introspection, moderation, and inner peace as foundations for a fulfilling life.",
