    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於逆境中的堅韌與重生。以鸞鳳比喻高貴之人，雨打翎毛象徵突如其來的挫折；被雀輕欺則顯現周遭小人的嘲笑與挑戰。然晨光破雲，卻依舊能振羽展翼，暗示盡管逆境短暫，內在力量仍能重整旗鼓。詩中並未直接指向具體事件，而是以自然景象作隱喻，提醒讀者在困境中保持自我修養，等待時機再度展翅飛翔。此意象亦提示成功非一成不變，需善於在失意中調整心態，尋找再度起飛的契機。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about resilience and rebirth in adversity. Using the phoenix as a metaphor for noble individuals, the rain striking the plumage symbolizes sudden setbacks; being lightly bullied by sparrows illustrates mockery and challenge from those around. Yet dawn breaks through clouds, yet it still can raise its feathers and wings, suggesting that though adversity is brief, inner strength can reorganize and soar again. The poem does not point to a specific event directly, but uses natural scenes as a metaphor, reminding readers to maintain personal cultivation during hardship and wait for the right moment to fly again. This imagery also indicates that success is not fixed; one must adapt mindset during disappointment and seek opportunities to take off again.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは逆境における強靭さと再生についてです。鳳凰を高貴な人の比喩として用い、雨が羽毛を打つ様子は突如として起こる挫折を象徴します。雀に軽く嘲られることは、周囲の小人からの笑いと挑戦を示します。しかし、朝日の光が雲を破ると、再び羽を広げて飛び立つことができるため、逆境は一時的であり、内なる力が再び団結して飛翔できることを示唆しています。この詩は具体的な出来事に直接言及せず、自然の景色を隠喩として用い、苦境の中でも自己鍛錬を保ち、再び羽ばたく機会を待つよう読者に促します。成功は固定されたものではなく、失意の中で心構えを調整し、再び飛び立つ機会を探すべきだというメッセージも含んでいます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that even when a noble soul is battered by sudden hardship and mocked by trivial adversaries, its inherent resilience can rise anew once the storm passes. The imagery of the rain‑soaked phoenix feathers and the brief ridicule by sparrows serves as a reminder that setbacks are transient; the true measure lies in one’s ability to wait for the right moment, nurture inner strength, and then take flight again. \n\n1. Health – The poem suggests that physical or mental health may be temporarily disrupted by external pressures. Maintaining inner composure, adopting a calm mindset, and allowing time for healing are vital. By patiently awaiting recovery, one can restore vitality and re‑energize the body.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – It warns against trivial criticism from those close to us, encouraging patience and understanding during disputes. When partners, friends, or family members speak lightly or doubt our worth, the poem advises staying centered, listening, and resolving conflicts once emotions calm, thus restoring harmony.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – Professionally, obstacles and setbacks are inevitable. The verse advises perseverance, continuous skill development, and strategic patience. Only after the clouds clear can one confidently advance, launch projects, or assume leadership, mirroring the phoenix’s renewed flight.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – Financial hardships may arise; the poem encourages prudent management, disciplined saving, and measured risk‑taking. By allowing market volatility to subside, one can invest wisely and grow wealth when conditions become favorable, just as the phoenix waits for the day it can soar again.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – Family tensions or misunderstandings can feel like sparrow mockery. The message is to hold steady, respect each member’s role, and resolve conflicts once calm returns. This fosters a stable environment where each individual can pursue personal growth.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – Reputation can be tarnished by fleeting gossip. The imagery underscores the importance of staying true to values, allowing the storm of rumors to pass, and then restoring one’s standing. By demonstrating resilience, a person can rebuild credibility and re‑establish influence in their social circles.\n\nOverall, the poem invites us to see challenges as temporary weather, encouraging resilience, patience, and strategic tiverance across all aspects of life, so that we may ultimately rise and thrive like a phoenix in clear skies.",
