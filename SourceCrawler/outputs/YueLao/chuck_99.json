    "zh": "這首詩的主題是先苦其心志，即先行努力、內心苦修，方能得成就。詩句以「必先苦其心志」為核心，提醒人們在追求任何目標時，無論是婚姻、事業或人際關係，都必須先經歷內在的磨練與自我調整。苦其心志不僅是勞動的外在行動，更是一種精神層面的堅持與自律。若缺乏此種苦修，將難以突破困境、形成深厚情感或持續發展。詩句所蘊含的哲理，正是「先修心志，再創機遇」的思想，強調持續的內在努力才是長遠成功的關鍵。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is to cultivate one's will through hardship, implying that only by enduring inner trials can one achieve success. The line \"必先苦其心志\" emphasizes that before pursuing any goal—whether in marriage, career, or relationships—one must first experience inner refinement and self‑adjustment. The hardship of the mind is not merely external work, but a spiritual persistence and self‑discipline. Without such inner striving, it is difficult to break through difficulties, form deep emotions, or sustain development. The underlying philosophy is the principle of \"first train the mind, then seize opportunities,\" highlighting that continuous internal effort is the key to long‑term success.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは苦しみを通じて心を鍛えることであり、内なる試練を耐えることでのみ成功を収めることができるということを示しています。『必先苦其心志』という句は、結婚、キャリア、対人関係などどんな目標を追い求めるにせよ、まず内なる修練と自己調整を経験しなければならないことを強調しています。心の苦しみは外側の労働だけでなく、精神的な忍耐と自己規律をも表しています。このような内なる努力がなければ、困難を突破し、深い感情を育むことも、持続的な発展を遂げることも難しいのです。詩に込められた哲学は「まず心を鍛え、次に機会を掴む」という考え方で、長期的な成功の鍵は継続的な内面努力にあると強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that success in any endeavor—be it personal relationships, career pursuits, or inner development—requires a deliberate period of hardship and self‑discipline. The line \"必先苦其心志\" conveys that before achieving any meaningful outcome, one must first endure inner trials, refining willpower and cultivating perseverance. This concept emphasizes that true accomplishment arises from sustained internal effort rather than external circumstances or fleeting enthusiasm.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem advises mental resilience as a foundation for physical well‑being. By training one’s mind through adversity, the body is better equipped to withstand stress, recover faster, and maintain holistic health. Consistent inner discipline also promotes healthy habits and balanced lifestyles.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – In matters of the heart, the verse implies that genuine bonds are forged only after both parties have undergone personal growth. Patience, mutual understanding, and willingness to face inner doubts strengthen intimacy, enabling deeper emotional connections.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Professional success hinges on the perseverance highlighted in the poem. Ambitious individuals must first cultivate mental fortitude, setting realistic goals and learning from setbacks.
