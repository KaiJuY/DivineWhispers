    "zh": "這首詩的主題是緣分的時間跨度與變化，提醒人們對待感情與事業須有耐心與順應時機的智慧。詩句以「十年、七八年、五六年、三四年」列示不同人生命中關係形成所需的時間長短，暗示並非所有情感都能在短時間內完成，而是視個人情況而定。若在某段時間內看似無進展，須審慎觀察外在變化與自身心態。當機會來臨時，應快速把握，避免因延遲而錯失良機。此詩亦指出，緣分的發展往往受環境與內心的共同作用，需要在穩定與變化之間取得平衡，方能迎來圓滿的結果。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the temporal span and variability of fate, urging patience and adaptability in matters of affection and career. The lines list ten, seven or eight, five or six, three or four years, illustrating the varying durations required for relationships to form, implying that not all feelings resolve swiftly but depend on individual circumstances. If progress seems stalled, one must observe external changes and inner states carefully. When opportunity arises, act swiftly to avoid missing the right moment. The poem also suggests that destiny evolves through the interplay of environment and inner disposition, requiring a balance between stability and change to achieve a harmonious outcome.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは運命の時間的幅と変化であり、恋愛や仕事において忍耐と柔軟性を重視することを促しています。詩は『十年、七八年、五六年、三四年』と並べ、関係が築かれるまでに必要な時間が個々に異なることを示唆し、すべての感情が短期間で完結するわけではなく、個人の状況によると示唆しています。進展が見えにくい場合は、外部の変化と内面の状態を注意深く観察すべきです。機会が訪れたら、遅れずに素早く行動し、良い機会を逃さないようにしてください。この詩はまた、運命が環境と内面の相互作用によって進化し、安定と変化のバランスを取ることで調和の取れた結果に至ることを示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the formation and evolution of relationships, whether romantic or professional, depend heavily on the passage of time and the readiness of the individuals involved. It emphasizes patience and awareness, while also encouraging decisive action when the right moment presents itself. The poem outlines a progression—from a few years to a decade—highlighting that each person’s journey through emotional and social development unfolds at its own rhythm. It reminds us that delayed outcomes may not be failures, but opportunities for deeper understanding and resilience.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s message of patience can be applied to personal well‑being. Gradual progress—whether in mental resilience or physical recovery—requires consistent care over years. Rather than forcing rapid improvement, practitioners should support long‑term habits, acknowledging that healing often unfolds in incremental stages.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe varying time frames emphasize that love cannot be rushed. Couples should cultivate mutual understanding over several years, recognizing that a deep bond takes time to solidify. When an opportunity for growth appears, the promptness suggested in the poem serves as a reminder to embrace change rather than avoid it.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nIn professional life, the poem mirrors the reality that career advancement rarely happens overnight. Success usually materializes after years of learning, networking, and perseverance. The verses advise staying prepared, yet not becoming stagnant, and seizing opportunities once the right conditions emerge.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial stability similarly demands patience. Investments grow over years, and impulsive actions can lead to volatility. The poem encourages measured decision‑making, monitoring external market shifts, and capitalizing on favorable moments to maximize returns.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nWithin families, cohesion often requires extended effort. The poem’s cadence suggests that nurturing trust and shared values can take many years. When tensions arise, observing the broader context and acting decisively can restore harmony.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nSocial networks evolve gradually; reputations are built over time through consistent behavior. The poem underscores the need for steady engagement, while also remaining alert to timely opportunities—such as collaborations or public appearances—that can elevate one’s standing if approached with confidence.",
