    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對戀情中情感的細膩描繪。它以「意中人」與「人中意」交織，表明相互的眷戀與被眷戀，透露出情感的雙向性。詩中又提及「無情花鳥也情痴」，意在說明即使是被視為無情之物，也會因情而痴迷，進一步強調情感的普遍與無差別。此處用「痴」字突顯內心的炙熱與無法自制，與「花鳥」的自然之美相呼應，象徵戀情的純粹與真摯。整首詩以簡短句式展現愛意的悄然升起，暗示戀人之間在默默中相互吸引，情感從不需多言便能傳遞。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the delicate portrayal of emotions within romance. It intertwines 'the one in one's heart' and 'the heart within the person', indicating mutual affection and being cherished, revealing the two‑way nature of feeling. The verse mentions 'even the indifferent birds and flowers become obsessed', meaning even those considered emotionless can become enamored, further emphasizing the universality and indiscriminate nature of sentiment. Here the word 'obsessed' highlights the inner ardor and lack of self‑control, resonating with the natural beauty of 'birds and flowers', symbolizing the purity and sincerity of love. The entire poem, through concise phrasing, shows love quietly rising, suggesting that lovers attract each other silently, with emotions able to communicate without need for words.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、恋愛における感情の繊細な描写です。『意中人』と『人中意』を交差させ、互いに恋し、恋されることを示し、感情の双方向性を明らかにします。詩では『無情な花鳥も情に痴になる』と述べ、感情が無いと思われるものでも魅了されることを示し、感情の普遍性と差別のない性質をさらに強調します。『痴』という語は内面の熱意と自制できない様子を強調し、『花鳥』の自然美と共鳴し、恋の純粋さと真摯さを象徴します。全体として、簡潔な文体で愛が静かに上昇することを示し、恋人同士が無言で相互に惹きつけ合い、感情が言葉なしで伝わることを示唆しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a concise yet profound meditation on the nature of romantic longing and mutual affection. By juxtaposing the terms “意中人” (the beloved in one’s heart) and “人中意” (one’s heart within another person), the verse highlights a reciprocal bond where each individual simultaneously feels and is felt. The addition of “無情花鳥也情痴” extends this dynamic to all living things, suggesting that even entities traditionally perceived as indifferent—such as birds and flowers—can become infatuated when touched by emotion. This universality reinforces the idea that love is an innate force that permeates all aspects of existence, regardless of form or circumstance.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem's emphasis on inner passion and emotional equilibrium serves as a reminder that maintaining emotional balance is integral to physical well‑being. When one cultivates a calm yet ardent mindset, the body can better resist stress and maintain vitality.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The reciprocal imagery underscores the importance of mutual respect and understanding in romantic partnerships. By recognizing both the giver and the receiver of affection, couples can build deeper intimacy and sustain long‑term harmony.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Passion, represented by the “痴” of love, can inspire professional dedication. A steadfast commitment to one’s pursuits—just as one remains devoted to a beloved—may lead to perseverance and ultimately achievement.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The poem’s notion that even indifferent objects can become “obsessed” suggests that value is often created through emotional attachment. By investing emotionally in financial ventures, individuals may better nurture and protect their assets, fostering long‑term security.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The universal reach of affection promotes empathy toward family members, encouraging open communication and shared devotion. Such emotional investment can help resolve conflicts and reinforce familial bonds.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The idea that emotion permeates all creatures reminds us that our social conduct influences how we are perceived. By approaching relationships with genuine passion and consideration, one can cultivate a reputation of sincerity and reliability.",
