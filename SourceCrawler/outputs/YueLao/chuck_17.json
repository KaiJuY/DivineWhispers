    "en": "This poem's theme is to emphasize that virtue is the foundation of life, while wealth is a natural consequence. The author uses concise parallelism to point out that establishing virtue, speech, and achievement are the foundations of life; only virtue can guide wealth; if wealth comes first, it easily leads to moral decline. The poem also reminds people that in selecting a spouse, they should prioritize virtue over wealth, choose a good wife and husband, and avoid losing morality due to greed for money and possessions. Though brief, this saying embeds profound moral viewpoints and life values. Virtue is the basis of personal cultivation and a key in social interaction. Wealth without virtue guidance often becomes a trap of utilitarianism, even losing oneself. Therefore, the author not only criticizes greed but also advocates putting virtue first, letting wealth become an extension of virtue rather than the end itself.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、徳が人生の根本であり、財はその自然な結果であることを強調することです。作者は簡潔な対仗を用いて、徳・言・功の三つを人生の本質とし、唯徳のみが財を導くと指摘します。もし財を先に置けば、道徳の崩壊を招きやすくなります。詩はまた、配偶者を選ぶ際に、財より徳を優先し、良妻良夫を選び、金銭や物質への貪欲が道徳を失わせることを警告しています。この言葉は短いものの、深い道徳観と人生価値観を内包しています。徳は個人修養の基盤であり、社会的交際の鍵でもあります。徳の指導なしに財があると、功利主義の罠となり、自己を失う恐れがあります。したがって、作者は貪欲を批判するだけでなく、徳を最優先にし、財を徳の延長線とし、目的自体ではなくその成果とすることを提唱しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that virtue (德) constitutes the essential foundation of an individual’s life, while wealth (財) is merely a byproduct that naturally follows when one acts with integrity and moral purpose. The poet’s succinct couplet—“德者本也，財者末也”—encapsulates a timeless moral lesson: the pursuit of wealth should never eclipse the cultivation of character, and in matters of personal choice, especially marriage, the standard should be moral compatibility rather than material gain. The poem cautions against allowing material desires to dictate the course of one’s life, for such an attitude inevitably erodes virtue, distorts relationships, and leads to regret.\n\n1. **Health**\n   The poem reminds us that a sound mind and a strong moral compass are prerequisites for physical well‑being. When one is guided by virtue, healthy habits—regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest—are naturally adopted, because self‑discipline becomes part of the person’s character. Conversely, a life consumed by greed often leads to stress, sleep deprivation, and neglect of health.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships**\n   In romantic and familial bonds, the text advises to prioritize moral compatibility over material allure. A partnership founded on shared values, mutual respect, and integrity yields deeper intimacy, trust, and longevity. The poem warns that a focus on wealth can create tension, jealousy, and eventual dissolution of the relationship.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition**\n   Professional success is framed as an extension of one’s virtue. The pursuit of career advancement should stem from genuine skill, dedication, and ethical conduct. Ambition that is rooted in honesty tends to foster sustainable achievements, whereas ambition driven by greed can result in short‑lived victories and reputational damage.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances**\n   Wealth is portrayed as a tool, not a goal. The poem advises prudent acquisition and wise stewardship, emphasizing that the ethical source of money—just means—is paramount. Unethical wealth, regardless of its size, ultimately brings isolation and moral bankruptcy.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony**\n   Within the family unit, the poem underscores the role of virtue in creating harmony. When parents model integrity, children internalize fairness and responsibility, leading to a balanced household. Material excess, however, may breed entitlement and conflict.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation**\n   Reputation is the visible echo of one’s inner virtue. By conducting oneself with honesty, generosity, and humility, an individual builds a respected social network that offers mutual support. Conversely, a reputation built on financial flaunting invites criticism and may erode genuine friendships.",
