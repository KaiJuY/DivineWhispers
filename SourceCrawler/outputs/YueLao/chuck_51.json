  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that success is achieved by aligning with the natural flow of powerful forces—represented by the dragon and the tiger—and by acting with the calm composure of a sage. The clouds followingguest dragon and the wind following the tiger suggest that even the most subtle elements are guided by the dominant currents of power. When a wise person harnesses these currents without force, all aspects of creation become visible, symbolizing the manifestation of one's efforts into tangible results. This passage encourages readers to observe the larger patterns around them, adapt flexibly, and pursue their goals with humility and patience.\n\n1. Health: The poem underscores the importance of attuning one's body to natural rhythms. By following the fluidity of clouds and the steady pace of wind, one cultivates balance and resilience, reducing stress and promoting overall well‑being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: Harmony in relationships mirrors the synergy between dragon and tiger. When partners listen to each other's strengths and move in complementary directions, mutual understanding deepens, fostering lasting affection.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Success comes from recognizing the prevailing forces in one's industry and aligning strategies accordingly. A career path that respects market momentum, like a sage following wind, yields steady progress and accomplishment.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Fiscal prudence is likened to the clouds’ lightness and the wind’s unobtrusiveness. Wise investors heed market currents rather than impose force, thereby accumulating wealth sustainably and avoiding volatility.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Family unity thrives when members adapt to shared rhythms, just as the poem illustrates natural harmony. By respecting each other's roles and supporting collective growth, the household remains peaceful and prosperous.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Public standing grows when one's conduct aligns with societal currents. Demonstrating calm, thoughtful action—akin to the sage’s response to wind and cloud—builds a reputation for reliability and grace.",
