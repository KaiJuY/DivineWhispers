    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於人際交往與自我認識。作者指出，若無法直接認識一個人，則可藉由觀察其交友方式來判斷其品行。真正的友人皆以正直、守信為共識，與此人交往亦可推知其正直之本。這亦提示婚姻選配應以此原則為基礎：選擇能展現真誠與正直的伴侶，方能築造穩固之結。若無法得知其真實面貌，則以其朋友圈作為參照，並以此警戒慎選。此觀念亦與孔子所說「不知其人，視其友」相呼應，提醒我們慎選交往圈，才能避免被不良之風氣所影響。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about interpersonal relationships and self-recognition. The author points out that if one cannot directly know a person, one can judge his character by observing his choice of friends. A true friend shares integrity and trustworthiness as a common principle, and associating with such a person allows one to infer his uprightness. This also suggests that marriage selection should be based on this principle: choosing a partner who displays sincerity and integrity will build a solid bond. If one cannot know the person's true nature, one should refer to his circle of friends as a reference, and exercise caution in selection. This notion also echoes Confucius' saying \"Know not the man, look to his friends,\" reminding us to choose our associations carefully to avoid being influenced by bad winds.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは人間関係と自己認識についてです。作者は、直接その人物を知ることができない場合、彼の交友を観察することで彼の性格を判断できると指摘します。真の友人は正直さと信頼を共通の原則として共有し、その人物と交わることでその人物の正直さを推測できます。これは結婚相手の選択にも同じ原則が適用されるべきであり、誠実さと正直さを示すパートナーを選ぶことで堅固な結びつきを築くことができると示唆します。本当の性質を知ることができない場合は、彼の友人の輪を参照として用い、選択に慎重になるべきです。この考えは孔子の「人を知らずして友を見よ」という言葉と呼応し、悪い風向きを避けるために付き合いを慎重に選ぶように促します。",
    "reference": "《孔子家語》《六本》孔子曰：「吾死之後，則商也日益，賜也日損。」曾子曰：「何謂也？」子曰：「商也好與賢己者處，賜也好說不若己者。不知其子，視其父；不知其人，視其友；不知其君，視其所使；不知其地，視其草木。故曰：與善人居，如入芝蘭之室，久而不聞其香，即與之化矣；與不善人居，如入鮑魚之肆，久而不聞其臭，亦與之化矣。丹之所藏者赤，漆之所藏者黑。是以君子必慎其所與處者焉。」"

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that a person's true character can be inferred through the quality of their friends, and this principle extends to significant life choices such as marriage.

Health: The poem’s emphasis on surrounding oneself with virtuous companions underscores the importance of a supportive environment for physical and mental well‑being. Engaging with people who value honesty and discipline can foster healthy habits and reduce stress, thereby promoting overall vitality.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: In matters of romance, the text advises that a potential partner should exhibit the same integrity reflected in their friendships. A relationship built on mutual respect and shared moral standards tends to be more resilient, allowing partners to grow together in harmony.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: By choosing associates who adhere to principles of fairness and diligence, one creates a professional network that encourages ethical decision‑making and mutual advancement. These positive relationships can open doors to opportunities and provide constructive feedback, accelerating career development.\n\n4.

When family members emulate the virtues seen in their social circle, it nurtures trust and cooperation, strengthening the family unit.\n\n6.

Maintaining associations with reputable and upright individuals enhances social standing and fosters a positive public image, which in turn attracts further beneficial connections.",
