    "en": "This poem's theme is the uprightness of conduct and heart. The phrase 'Not ashamed before Heaven' signifies that when one's actions are righteous, there is no need to feel shame before the heavens; 'Unafraid of people' emphasizes that in dealing with others, one should not fear. The poem shows that maintaining honesty and courage prevents one from being shaken by external judgments, achieving inner tranquility. This sentence also reminds that uprightness is not only a moral level but a navigation for life's path; if one keeps this attitude, one can proceed calmly regardless of storm. This perspective also echoes the core of ancient and modern benevolence, stressing that by facing oneself and others honestly, one can gain dual respect from Heaven and society. In today's world, especially in social and professional settings, people often judge by appearance and reputation, overlooking inner uprightness; the poem reminds that true honor comes from steadfast internal integrity and self‑faith.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、行動と心の正直さです。『天に愧なく』という言葉は、行いが正しいとき、天地に羞恥する必要がないことを示しています。『人に畏れず』は、他者と接する際に恐れを抱くべきではないことを強調します。詩は、正直さと勇気を保つことで、外部の評価に揺らぐことなく内なる安寧を得られると示しています。さらに、正直さは道徳的層面だけでなく人生の航路としても機能し、常にこの姿勢を保てば、嵐があっても堂々と前進できると教えています。この見解は、古今の仁義の核心と呼応し、自己と他者を正直に向き合うことで、天地と社会からの二重の敬意を得られると説いています。現代では、特に社会的・職業的場面で、外観や評判で判断しがちで、内なる正直さを見失いがちです。本句は、真の栄光は Händiに内在する堅守と自らの誠実さから来ると訴えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a profound statement about the importance of personal integrity, both in the face of higher moral authority and in everyday social interactions. The refrain ‘Not ashamed before Heaven’ emphasizes that righteous conduct naturally commands respect from the cosmos, negating any sense of shame. Meanwhile, ‘Unafraid of people’ encourages confidence in interpersonal dealings, suggesting that fear has no place when one’s actions are honest and courageous. Together, these lines serve as a moral compass, guiding individuals toward a life that remains unshaken by external judgment and attains inner tranquility. They also echo a larger philosophical tradition that values honesty as both a moral and a practical roadmap for life.\n\n**Personal Development**\nThe poem encourages individuals to cultivate honesty and courage in their daily actions. By fostering these traits, one becomes less susceptible to external criticism, leading to greater self‑confidence and inner peace.

This mindset reduces the influence of societal judgment, allowing for more sincere and balanced social engagement.

Cultivating honest self‑practice and confronting reality courageously creates a durable legacy that endures beyond fleeting praise or criticism.",
