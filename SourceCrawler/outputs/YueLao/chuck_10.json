    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於「養兒防老、積穀防飢」的古訓。詩中指出，養育子女不僅是為家庭傳承之道，也是長者未來安寧的根基。隨著年華增長，親子之間的相互扶持可成為長者生活的慰藉與陪伴；同時，子女在成長過程中應接受良好教養，才能為家庭帶來和諧與繁榮。積累糧食則是對未來不可預測困境的預備。古人以“積穀”作比，寓意節儉與長期規劃，藉此減輕飢荒或經濟波動對家庭的衝擊。綜合來看，詩句強調先進者需兼顧現實與未來，以家族為核心，實踐養育與節儉的雙重責任，進而維繫世代延續與安定。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about the ancient adage of \"raising children to guard against old age, and storing grain to guard against hunger.\" It explains that nurturing offspring is not only a means of familial succession but also the foundation for a senior’s future peace. As years accumulate, mutual support between parents and children can become a comfort and companion for the elderly; meanwhile, children should receive sound education during their growth so as to bring harmony and prosperity to the household. Accumulating food is a preparedness for unforeseeable future hardships. The ancients likened this to “storing grain,” symbolizing frugality and long‑term planning to lessen the impact of famine or economic fluctuations on families. In sum, the poem emphasizes that the forward‑looking generation must balance present and future, treat the family as the core, and practice the dual responsibilities of nurturing and thrift, thereby sustaining generational continuity and stability.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは「子育てで老いを防ぎ、穀物を蓄えることで飢えを防ぐ」という古い教訓に関するものです。詩は、子育ては家族の継承手段であるだけでなく、老後の安寧の基盤ともなると述べています。歳月が進むにつれて、親子の相互扶助は老いの慰めと共に伴うものであり、同時に子どもは成長過程で良い教育を受けるべきであり、家族に調和と繁栄をもたらします。穀物を蓄えることは、将来の予測できない困難に備える策です。古人は「穀物を蓄える」ことを節約と長期計画の象徴として比喩し、飢饉や経済変動が家族に与える衝撃を軽減する手段としました。総じて、詩は先進世代が現実と未来を両立させ、家族を中心に養育と倹約の両責任を実践し、世代の継続と安定を維持することを強調しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the wise management of both human and material resources lays the groundwork for a secure future. The text emphasizes two interrelated strategies: first, nurturing children as a long‑term safety net against aging, ensuring that the elder generation is supported by the next; second, amassing grain as a practical hedge against famine, a lesson in prudence and foresight. Together, these practices reflect a holistic approach to resilience—personal, familial, and societal. The poem’s brevity belies its profound counsel: proactive planning, intergenerational responsibility, and disciplined stewardship form the pillars of enduring stability.\n\n1. **Health** – By investing in children’s well‑being, the poem suggests that a healthy next generation serves as a protective layer for future aging. It implies that preventive care (education, nutrition, exercise) can mitigate health decline and reduce dependence on external aid.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The emphasis on mutual support between parents and children underlines the emotional bond that sustains families. A strong relational fabric ensures that care is reciprocated, fostering intimacy and shared purpose.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The call to store grain mirrors the professional ethic of saving and skill accumulation. Building a reservoir of experience and resources can cushion career setbacks and enable long‑term achievement.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Accumulating grain serves as an allegory for prudent saving and diversified investments. The message encourages disciplined budgeting, reducing debt, and creating a safety net that protects against economic volatility.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The poem stresses that collective well‑being relies on intergenerational cooperation. A harmonious family nurtures cooperation, respect, and shared responsibility, which in turn promotes collective prosperity.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – By demonstrating foresight and stewardship, one gains respect and trust within the community. A reputation for prudence invites collaborative opportunities, reinforcing social capital and mutual support.\n\nOverall, the verse teaches that thoughtful preparation—both in nurturing human capital and in safeguarding material assets—establishes a resilient foundation that benefits individuals, families, and society at large.",
