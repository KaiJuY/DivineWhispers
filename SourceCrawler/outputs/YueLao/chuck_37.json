    "en": "This poem's theme is the essential role that a wife plays in maintaining the fabric of kinship within the household. The terse couplet, '妻焉者，親之主也。', conveys that a wife is not merely a partner but the pivotal link that binds relatives together. Her nurturing, empathy, and stewardship nurture the intimacy among family members, fostering cohesion and ensuring the continuity of lineage. The author exhorts that the attitude toward a wife should mirror the reverence accorded to parents and children, underscoring principles of equality, mutual regard, and reciprocal care. Such an outlook reflects the Confucian ethic that places familial affection at the heart of moral conduct, urging that, in everyday domestic practice, one must honor the spouse with the same dignity and duty as one does kin, thereby cultivating a stable, harmonious, and prosperous home.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、妻が家族内の結びつきを保ち、親しい関係を維持する上で果たす重要な役割である。『妻焉者、親之主也。』という簡潔な句は、妻が単なる伴侶ではなく、親族を結びつける重要な結び目であることを示している。妻の育成、共感、奉仕は、家族間の親密さを育み、団結を促進し、血統の継続を保証する。筆者は、妻に対する態度を親や子供に対する尊敬と愛情に合わせるべきだと説き、平等、相互尊重、相互のケアの原則を強調している。この観点は、儒教の倫理観の核心である「親情」を表し、日常の家庭生活で配偶者を同じ敬意と責任で扱うべきだと促している。",
