    "en": "This poem's theme is the farewell and the resonant reflection of nature. The author likens the departure of the phoenix from the Qin Pavilion to the departure of a person or a matter; the clouds gathering over Wushan reveals a change in the heavens and a sense of sorrow. The poem, concise in its two lines, emphasizes the ending of a relationship or emotion, and mirrors the inner state through natural imagery. In classical poetry, the phoenix symbolizes nobility and longevity, and its departure, though it implies separation, also signifies a necessary conclusion. The Qin Pavilion, as an ancient architectural site, together with the phoenix, denotes the place of farewell. The clouds gathering over Wushan symbolize the release of suppressed feelings, indicating that this situation cannot be undone, and only acceptance of the conclusion remains.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは別れと自然の反響である。作者は鳳凰が秦楼を去ることを、人や物事の離れを比喩し、雲が巫山に集まることで天の変化と哀愁を表す。詩は簡潔な二行で、関係や感情の終結を強調し、自然の景色で内面を映し出す。古典詩では鳳凰は高貴と長寿を象徴し、離れることで分離を示す一方、必要な結末を示唆する。秦楼は古代の建造物として、鳳凰とともに別れの場所を示す。雲が巫山に集まることは抑えられた感情の放出を象徴し、状況が戻せないことを示し、結末を受け入れるしかないことを示す。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a subtle illustration of a farewell whose resonance is echoed in the shifting skies, revealing that the ending of a bond, whether emotional or situational, is inevitable and must be accepted with calmness. The image of the phoenix departing the Qin Pavilion, coupled with the gathering of clouds over Wushan, conveys a sense of finality and the emotional release that follows.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem suggests that after a major emotional upheaval, one should allow oneself time to heal. Just as the clouds settle over the mountain, a mind in distress can find calm after the storm of feelings. Practicing patience and giving the body rest supports this natural recovery process.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nIn relationships, the verse warns that a passionate bond may inevitably part. The phoenix’s departure signals the need to respect a partner’s decision. Recognizing when to let go preserves dignity for both parties and opens space for new connections.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nThe narrative mirrors professional shifts, where a respected position may be relinquished. Embracing such change with humility, like watching the clouds gather, signals readiness to pursue fresh goals. Adaptability becomes the key to future success.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nThe transient nature of wealth is implied; prosperity may pass like the bird. Maintaining balance and not clinging to material gains ensures a smooth transition when financial tides shift. Strategic planning mirrors the foresight seen in the poem’s imagery.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily ties may also dissolve or rearrange. Accepting departures with grace fosters a supportive atmosphere. The gathering clouds indicate that family members, though distant, remain connected through shared memories and mutual respect.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nPublic perception changes as people move on. Building a reputation built on authenticity rather than permanence allows one to thrive amid social flux. Like the phoenix’s flight, reputation can be reborn after each departure.",
