    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對離別與相思的深刻描寫。作者以「子規」為象徵，傳達半夜啼血的哀怨情景，揭示主人翁遠離故鄉、心繫他鄉之人的痛苦與孤寂。子規即杜鵑，常被喻為「吐血鳥」，其悲鳴猶如嘆息，象徵離散者心中無盡的哀愁。詩中「不信東風喚不回」暗示人們對春風吹拂帶來的希望心存疑慮，亦是對「回鄉」願望的擱置與失落。整體而言，詩意在於呼喚情感與離別的交織，提醒人們在遠行與思鄉之際，保持對彼此的信任與期待。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the profound depiction of separation and longing. The author uses the \"子規\" as a symbol to convey the sorrowful scene of mid‑night cries of blood, revealing the protagonist's pain and loneliness when away from home and caring for someone far away. The 子規, or cuckoo, is often referred to as the \"blood‑spitting bird,\" and its mournful cry echoes a sigh, symbolizing the endless grief of those separated. The line \"不信東風喚不回\" suggests that people doubt the hope that the east wind brings, and it also implies the postponement and loss of the wish to return home. Overall, the poem calls attention to the intertwining of emotion and parting, reminding us to keep trust and hope for one another during travel and homesickness.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、別離と恋思いを深く描写したものです。作者は「子規」を象徴として用い、半夜に血を吐く悲鳴の場面を描き、故郷を離れ、遠くの人を想う主人公の苦しみと孤独を明らかにします。子規はダチョウに似た「吐血鳥」とも呼ばれ、その悲鳴はため息のようで、離れた者の尽きることのない悲しみを象徴します。「不信東風喚不回」という一節は、人々が東風がもたらす希望を疑い、帰郷の願いが遅延・喪失されていることを示唆します。全体として、この詩は感情と別れの絡み合いを呼びかけ、遠出や恋思いの際に互いへの信頼と期待を保つように促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a vivid portrayal of the anguish felt by those separated from home and loved ones. The image of the 子規 (cuckoo) lamenting with blood at midnight symbolizes profound sorrow, while the skepticism towards the east wind’s call reflects doubt over hopeful returns and the lingering loss of longing for one’s homeland. The poem intertwines emotion with the theme of parting, urging trust and hope amid distance and homesickness. \n\n1. Health – The vivid description of a creature “crying blood” metaphorically points to emotional distress that can manifest physically. It reminds readers to be vigilant about mental well‑being, especially when experiencing loneliness or longing.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – The poem underscores how yearning for distant loved ones can erode faith. It advises maintaining open communication and expressing care, ensuring that distance does not erode emotional bonds.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – For those pursuing opportunities far from home, the piece warns of the emotional toll. It encourages balancing ambition with self‑care, recognizing that professional pursuits should not come at the cost of personal harmony.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – While not directly addressing finances, the sense of loss can mirror financial uncertainty. It suggests prudent budgeting during relocation or travel, avoiding undue risk due to emotional impulsiveness.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – The longing for home resonates with family cohesion. The poem invites nurturing familial ties through regular contact, especially when living apart, to sustain mutual support.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The skepticism towards the east wind’s call serves as a reminder that external promises may be unreliable. It encourages building a reputation grounded in sincerity and reliability, rather than fleeting assurances.",
