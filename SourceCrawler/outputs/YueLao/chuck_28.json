    "en": "This poem's theme is the profound bond between spouses and siblings. The poem centers on the phrase '夫婦也，昆弟也', likening the marital relationship to that of siblings, emphasizing that each should treat the other with the intimacy of brothers and sisters, and expressing mutual respect and love through the notion of 'treating each other as guests'. It then depicts the couple as birds with joined wings, portraying their union as a coordinated flight toward an ideal future. The entire poem encourages people to view marriage as the closest partnership, to uphold promises, support each other, and ultimately achieve lasting happiness. When spouses regard each other with a sibling-like mindset, one sees not only the sweetness of affection but also opportunities for mutual growth and learning. Such mutual support strengthens their resilience in adversity and sets a positive example in society, illustrating what true family harmony looks like.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、夫婦と兄弟姉妹の深い絆です。詩は『夫婦也、昆弟也』というフレーズを中心に、夫婦関係を兄弟姉妹に例え、互いに兄弟姉妹のように親密に接し、『相敬如賓』という概念を通じて互いの敬愛を表現しています。次に、夫婦を翼を合わせた鳥にたとえ、理想的な未来へと協調して飛翔する姿を描写します。詩全体では、結婚を最も親密なパートナーシップとして捉え、約束を守り、互いに支え合い、最終的に長続きする幸せを手に入れるよう促しています。夫婦が兄弟的な心で接すると、愛情の甘さだけでなく、相互成長と学びの機会も見えてきます。互いに支え合うことで、困難な時により強靭になり、社会に良い模範を示し、真の家族の和のあり方を示すのです。",
