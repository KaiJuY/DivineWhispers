    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於珍惜青春與否定物質羈絆的哲理。詩中以金縷衣作為富貴與外在美好的象徵，提醒人們不要因為外在華麗而迷失自己的本質；而少年時光則被視為最珍貴、最易逝的資源，應當把握並善用。詩意蘊含「把握當下，勿等機會遺失」的警示，並強調青春是人生黃金時段，若不珍惜，將如花落時徒拈枝。最後以勸君之語，傳達一種對人生選擇與時間價值的深刻思考。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about valuing youth while rejecting material entanglements. The poem uses a gold‑threaded robe as a symbol of wealth and outward beauty, warning that one should not be lost in external splendor but instead focus on one’s essence; meanwhile, the adolescent years are portrayed as the most precious and fleeting resource to seize and use wisely. The poem conveys a cautionary message of “seize the moment before opportunity slips away,” emphasizing that youth is the golden period of life, and if neglected it will be like a flower that withers while its branches are still plucked. Ultimately, the poem speaks in a tone of counsel, urging a deep reflection on life choices and the value of time.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、物質的な拘束を否定しつつ青春を大切にするという哲学です。詩は金縷衣を富と外見の美しさの象徴として用い、外見の華やかさに溺れず自分本来の姿を見失わないように警告します。そして少年時代を最も貴重で消えやすい資源とみなし、機会を逃す前にそれを捉えて賢く活用するべきだと説きます。詩は「今をつかめ、機会が失われる前に」という戒めを伝え、青春が人生の黄金時代であると強調し、放棄すると花が散るように枝を摘むだけになると示唆しています。最後に、詩は人生の選択と時間の価値について深く考えるように促す言葉で締めくくられます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a dual admonition: do not cherish material opulence (the gold‑threaded robe) while you should cherish the fleeting youth that constitutes the most valuable phase of life. The poet uses the robe as a symbol of external wealth and superficial allure, warning that such adornments can distract from true purpose. In contrast, the youth is portrayed as a precious, rapidly passing resource that must be seized. The underlying philosophy emphasizes seizing opportunities before they vanish, treating the adolescent years as life’s golden period, and avoiding the regret of a wasted potential. The message thus calls for a conscious allocation of time and values, privileging inner growth over outward appearance.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem implicitly urges attention to the temporal nature of life. By valuing youth, it reminds us to maintain good health early on to maximize the years available. Neglecting health now can diminish the ability to enjoy future opportunities.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe caution against clinging to material excess suggests that true connection stems from authenticity rather than possessions. Relationships that flourish when both partners appreciate youthfulness and personal growth are likely to be more resilient and sincere.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nYouthful vigor is a key asset in career development. The poem encourages leveraging early years to acquire skills and network, rather than postponing ambition in pursuit of luxury or comfort. Early action lays a foundation for long‑term success.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nMaterial wealth, symbolized by the gold‑threaded robe, is portrayed as superficial and potentially distracting. Wise financial decisions prioritize investment in experiences and education that sustain long‑term prosperity rather than short‑term display.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe admonition to cherish youth aligns with family values that promote shared growth and mutual support. A family that nurtures young members’ development creates harmony and resilience, ensuring that wealth of experience outweighs material gifts.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nA reputation built on authenticity and timely engagement is more enduring than one based on opulent display. The poem encourages forming networks early, valuing genuine interactions over the allure of wealth, thereby establishing lasting social capital.",
