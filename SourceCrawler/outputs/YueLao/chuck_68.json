    "en": "This poem's theme is about how in the world many people carry various burdens, especially women who face emotional weight, and the poet advises listeners not to blindly become the bearer of others' burdens. The line \"天下多負人，何必是。\" uses \"天下\" as a metaphor, suggesting that the world is filled with people who need to be \"負\", implying that when choosing partners or relationships, one should prioritize personal value and happiness, avoiding damage to body and mind from others' burdens. The poem also mentions that a burden may bring future happiness, yet its outcome is unpredictable, so one should not become overly sorrowful due to its weight. The poem emphasizes self-control and choice, urging people to stay alert when facing emotional relationships, to avoid losing themselves over others' matters, and to seek a partner who can truly bring happiness.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、世界中に多くの人々が様々な負担を抱えていること、特に女性が直面する感情的な負担に焦点を当て、詩人が聴衆に対し、他人の負担を盲目的に背負う必要はないと告げることである。詩句「天下多負人，何必是。」は「天下」を比喩として用い、世間には「負」されるべき人が溢れていることを示し、伴侶や関係を選ぶ際には自己価値と幸福を優先し、他者の負担によって身体と精神が損なわれることを避けるべきだと示唆している。詩はまた、負担が将来の幸福をもたらす可能性があるものの、その結果は予測できないため、過度に悲しむべきではないと述べている。詩意は自己管理と選択を強調し、感情関係に直面したときに警戒を保ち、他人の問題により自分を失わないようにし、真に幸福をもたらす伴侶を求めるよう促している。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that in a world where many people carry burdens—particularly the emotional loads that women often bear—the speaker cautions against becoming the bearer of such hardships. The line \"天下多負人，何必是\" metaphorically indicates that the world is full of those who need to be held or supported, yet it urges the individual to prioritize self‑worth and personal happiness instead of taking on others’ weight. The poem acknowledges that these burdens may eventually bring joy, but their outcomes remain uncertain, and therefore one should not be overwhelmed by sorrow. Ultimately, it advocates for self‑control, discernment, and the pursuit of partners who genuinely contribute to one's wellbeing, rather than allowing external responsibilities to erode one’s own spirit.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem warns against the physical and mental strain that arises from carrying another’s burden. By choosing to focus on one’s own wellbeing, one protects both body and mind from exhaustion and resentment.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – It advises selecting partners who bring reciprocal support and happiness, not those who impose undue emotional weight. Healthy relationships should nurture both individuals, avoiding one‑sided care that leads to imbalance.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The message implies that over‑committing to others’ problems can distract from professional goals. By maintaining boundaries, one can pursue career aspirations without being sidetracked by external obligations.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Excessive responsibility for another’s troubles may also strain financial resources. The poem encourages prudent allocation of funds, ensuring that personal finances are secure before extending aid.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Within families, the poem’s advice promotes emotional equilibrium. Family members should support each other but also respect individual limits, fostering a harmonious environment rather than one dominated by burden.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – The poem suggests that society may view the burden‑bearer as generous, but this perception can mask personal depletion. Maintaining a balanced social presence ensures that one’s reputation is built on mutual respect, not sacrificial endurance.",
