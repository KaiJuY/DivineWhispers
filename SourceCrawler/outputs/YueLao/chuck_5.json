    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於在相遇中主動把握機會以獲得婚姻。詩句以「踰東家牆而摟其處子」描繪男女相遇的瞬間，暗示若能主動靠近並示好，即可得到心儀的配偶；相反，若錯過或不敢接近，便難以成婚。作者借此提醒，婚姻不是偶然的安排，而是需要行動與勇氣。面對情感機會，應當果斷與積極，否則機會將不再。此詩亦告訴人們，關鍵在於「是否摟」——即主動與被動的選擇。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is about seizing opportunities in encounters to secure marriage. The lines depict, with 'passing beyond the eastern wall and hugging the maiden,' the moment of meeting, suggesting that if one takes the initiative to approach and show affection, one can obtain a beloved spouse; conversely, if one misses or hesitates, marriage may be unattainable. The author uses this to remind us that marriage is not merely an accident but requires action and courage. When facing emotional chances, one should act decisively and proactively, otherwise the opportunity disappears. The poem also teaches that the key lies in 'hugging or not'—the choice between action and passivity.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、出会いの中で機会を掴み、結婚を確保することに関するものです。詩句は『東家の壁を越えて、若い女性を抱きしめる』という描写で、出会いの瞬間を示し、積極的に近づき好意を示せば、望む配偶者を得られると示唆しています。逆に、機会を逃したり躊躇したりすると、結婚が叶わない可能性があります。作者は、結婚は偶然の産物ではなく、行動と勇気が必要であることを示唆しています。感情のチャンスに直面したら、決断力と積極性を持って行動すべきであり、そうしないと機会は消えてしまいます。この詩は『抱きしめるかどうか』、すなわち行動と受動の選択に重要性があることも教えています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that marriage is attained through proactive engagement rather than passive waiting; the act of physically embracing the prospective partner symbolizes taking initiative, and the consequence of not doing so is losing the chance to marry. The poem encourages the reader to recognize that meaningful relationships arise from decisive actions and that hesitation can result in missed opportunities.\n\n1. Health\n   The poem indirectly urges physical presence and openness. Engaging with others and maintaining close contact can improve mental well‑being and reduce isolation. A proactive lifestyle that involves interpersonal interaction can foster a healthier mind and body.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\n   The central message is about active pursuit of partnership. To build a lasting union, one must act, show affection, and not delay. Courage in expressing feelings increases the likelihood of a successful relationship.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\n   Seizing opportunities parallels career advancement. Just as the poem rewards those who step forward, ambition requires taking initiatives, making bold moves, and not hesitating to apply for positions or propose projects.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\n   Financial stability often grows from proactive behavior. Taking the initiative in investments, savings plans, or entrepreneurship can lead to greater wealth. Delay or inaction can result in stagnation or loss of potential earnings.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\n   Building a harmonious family life relies on decisive actions. Embracing responsibilities, showing affection, and actively resolving conflicts can strengthen family bonds. Avoiding engagement may create distance and conflict.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\n   The poem teaches that social standing is built through engagement. Actively participating in social circles, expressing interest in others, and forging new relationships can enhance reputation. Conversely, avoiding interaction can lead to isolation and a lack of support network.",
