    "zh": "這首詩的主題是對遲遲相逢之情感與無奈的感慨。詩句『恨相見晚也』揭示了兩人在相遇時已失去許多青春與機會，時間的推移使彼此變得陌生。作者以眼前之人為主體，稱其為『伊人』，既表現出對對方的愛慕，也透露出心中對無法改變命運的遺憾。整首詩以簡短的語言呈現情感的矛盾：既想親近又被命運牽制，最終只能以觀望之姿守望。此處的『惟探望之下』與『伊人己身有主』暗示著無論願望多強，關係仍受外界限制，無法擺脫宿命的安排。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the lamentation of a late encounter and the helplessness in facing destiny. The line \"恨相見晚也\" indicates that both parties have lost a lot of youth and opportunities by the time they meet, and time has made them strangers. The author focuses on the person before them, calling him or her \"伊人\", showing affection while also expressing regret over the inability to change fate. The poem uses concise language to depict a paradox of emotion: wanting to approach yet restrained by destiny, ultimately only being able to watch from a distance. The phrase \"惟探望之下\" and \"伊人己身有主\" suggest that no matter how strong the wish, the relationship remains constrained by external forces and cannot escape the arrangement of destiny.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは遅い出会いへの嘆きと、運命に対する無力さにあります。『恨相見晚也』という一節は、両者が出会うまでに多くの青春と機会を失っており、時間の経過でお互いが見知らぬ存在になったことを示しています。作者は目の前の人物を『伊人』と呼び、愛情を示すと同時に、運命を変えられないことへの後悔を表現しています。詩は簡潔な言葉で感情の矛盾―近づきたいが運命に縛られ、結局は遠くから見守るしかない―を描き出しています。『惟探望之下』と『伊人己身有主』というフレーズは、願いがどんなに強くても、関係は外部の制約に左右され、宿命から逃れられないことを暗示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a lament over the late meeting of two hearts, highlighting the tragic conflict between longing and the inexorable force of destiny. The brief yet potent line reminds the reader that time, once slipped past, brings distance and inevitability. Even with sincere affection, one may find themselves bound by circumstances beyond their control, turning hopes into quiet observation.\n\n1. Health: The poem encourages mindful attention to the emotional health of individuals. The realization that external factors can limit personal connections serves as a reminder to prioritize self‑care, reducing stress and preventing emotional burnout.\n2. Love and Relationships: It underscores the necessity of accepting that some bonds may remain unfulfilled, yet this acceptance can foster resilience. The poem advises that love is not only about attachment but also about graceful relinquishment.\n3. Career and Ambition: The theme of fate versus effort parallels professional pursuits. The message suggests balancing ambition with realistic expectations, recognizing that not all goals will align perfectly with the timeline.\n4. Wealth and Finances: While the poem does not directly address finances, the metaphor of being constrained by destiny parallels financial limitations. The lesson is to plan wisely, acknowledging that resources may be limited and must be managed prudently.\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem invites reflection on familial relationships that may suffer from untimely meetings or misunderstandings. It encourages open communication and the willingness to accept imperfections in family dynamics.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: The idea that one may observe rather than participate resonates with social networks. It implies that sometimes stepping back can preserve one’s reputation and mental well-being, especially when external pressures threaten personal integrity.",
