    "zh": "這首詩的主題是關於人際關係與命運的觀照，特別聚焦於尋愛與伴侶選擇之道。作者以「宗室之美」作為起點，暗示人人皆有美好潛能，並非貴族天賦。其後指出「時局已變遷，已無五爵之分」，呼籲世人抛開階級界線，平等對待彼此。詩中提及「人生而平等，並無天子」的觀念，強調命運並非由天命決定，而是取決於個人對愛與緣分的態度。最後以「宜以愛心與緣份為重可也」作結，提醒尋偶者不應只看門當戶對，而是以真誠之心尋求相互扶持的伴侶。整體而言，詩句以平衡、善意與自我覺察為主旨，呈現一種包容且現實的情感觀。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a contemplation of interpersonal relations and destiny, particularly focusing on the path of seeking love and partners. The author begins with \"宗室之美\" (the beauty of a noble house) to suggest that everyone possesses a beautiful potential, not merely a noble birthright. He then states that \"the situation has changed, and the five ranks are gone,\" urging people to discard class boundaries and treat each other equally. The poem emphasizes that \"all people are born equal, and there is no emperor,\" indicating that fate is not determined by divine will but by one's attitude toward love and destiny. Finally, it concludes with \"let love and destiny be paramount,\" reminding seekers not to focus solely on social status, but to pursue a partner with genuine affection and mutual support. Overall, the verses promote balance, goodwill, and self‑awareness, presenting a tolerant and realistic view of emotions.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人間関係と運命についての思索で、特に恋愛と伴侶選びの道に焦点を当てています。作者は「宗室之美」（貴族家系の美しさ）という言葉で、すべての人に美しい可能性があることを示し、貴族の生まれによるものではないと暗示しています。その後、「時局已変遷、已無五爵之分」と述べ、階級の境界を捨て平等に対処するよう促します。詩は「人生而平等、並無天子」という考えを強調し、運命は神の意思ではなく、愛と縁に対する姿勢によって決まると示しています。最後に「宜以愛心與緣份為重可也」と結び、相手を選ぶ際には社会的地位にだけ注目せず、真摯な心で相互扶助の伴侶を求めるべきだと教えます。全体として、詩句はバランス、善意、自分の気づきを重視し、包容力と現実的な感情観を提示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the quest for love and companionship should transcend social status and class divisions, emphasizing equality, mutual respect, and sincere affection. It encourages individuals to search for partners among ordinary people, focusing on shared values rather than inherited prestige, and highlights that destiny is shaped by one's own disposition toward love rather than predetermined hierarchies.\n\n1. Health\nThe poem’s implicit call for balance and emotional harmony suggests that a healthy relationship can foster mental well‑being. By advocating for mutual respect and genuine care, it encourages partners to support each other’s emotional health, reducing stress and promoting overall vitality.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe central message is that true companionship arises from shared hearts and common fate, not from external status. It advises seeking a partner who values love over wealth or rank, emphasizing the importance of empathy, affection, and the willingness to build a partnership grounded in mutual understanding.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nThe text warns against allowing social hierarchies to dictate one’s personal aspirations. It inspires individuals to pursue career goals that align with personal values, not merely those that enhance social standing. A balanced outlook can lead to sustainable professional satisfaction without compromising personal relationships.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial prosperity is implied to be secondary to emotional integrity. The poem’s message indicates that wealth should not become a deciding factor in choosing a life partner. Instead, financial stability should be approached responsibly, ensuring that it supports rather than dominates relational harmony.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nThe notion that \"all people are born equal\" invites a family structure that embraces diversity and shared responsibilities. It encourages harmonious living arrangements based on mutual respect, where each member’s needs are met through affection and cooperation rather than through rigid titles or expectations.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nThe text discourages the pursuit of status at the expense of genuine connections. By prioritizing love and destiny, individuals can build a reputation grounded in kindness and sincerity, fostering trust and long‑term alliances that are resilient to social fluctuations.",
