    "zh": "這首詩的主題是「姑舍是」，簡潔而深奧，提醒人們在面對人際與事務時，應該適時放下、退讓，以免陷入無謂爭端。詩句以「姑」作為動作動詞，表達先行舍棄、先行放手的決斷；「舍」則是對於不利因素的拋棄；「是」則強調這種選擇乃是正確之道。此句所呈現的境界，像是戰場上一名勇士斷斷指，果斷離場，避免在刀光劍影中遭受損傷。作者以此比喻提醒讀者，若不果斷舍棄，將被困於是非、矛盾之中，失去進步與利益。該詩以短短四字，卻蘊含了寬闊的哲理：適時的退讓、適度的謙遜，是自我保護與社會和諧的基石，亦是人際互動中智慧的體現。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is \"姑舍是\", a succinct yet profound reminder that in confronting interpersonal affairs and tasks, one should timely relinquish and step back to avoid unnecessary disputes. The phrase uses '姑' as an action verb, conveying a decisive act of discarding and stepping aside; '舍' signifies the abandonment of adverse elements; '是' emphasizes that such choice is correct. The poem presents a scenario like a warrior severing his fingers, decisively leaving the battlefield to avoid harm. The author, through this metaphor, cautions that without decisive relinquishment, one will be trapped in controversies and conflicts, losing progress and benefits. Though composed of just four characters, the poem embeds expansive philosophy: timely retreat, modest humility, and self‑protection are the cornerstone of harmony, embodying wisdom in interpersonal interactions.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは「姑舍是」です。簡潔ながら深い教えで、対人関係や事務に直面した際に、適時手放し退くことで無意味な争いを避けるべきだと示しています。『姑』は行動動詞として、断固とした放棄と退く意思を表し、『舍』は有害な要素を捨てることを意味し、『是』はその選択が正しいことを強調します。この詩は、剣と刀が光る戦場で勇士が指を切り、戦場を離れるように、決断的に離脱することで被害を回避する姿を比喩しています。作者はこの比喩で、決断的に手放さないと争いに巻き込まれ、進展や利益を失うと警告しています。たった四文字でありながら、広範な哲学を含み、適時の後退と謙遜が自己保護と社会調和の礎であること、そして人間関係での知恵を体現しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the essence of the line \"姑舍是\" lies in the wisdom of timely retreat and decisive relinquishment. It teaches that in the face of conflict, competition, or unfruitful engagements, the prudent course is to step back and abandon what is harmful, rather than clinging to it and risking damage or loss. This guidance extends beyond the immediate context of the poem, offering a philosophical framework that can be applied to multiple aspects of life. \n\n1. Health: The principle of letting go encourages avoidance of unnecessary stress and conflict, which can lead to physical and mental strain. By stepping away from toxic relationships or overwhelming tasks, one preserves energy and maintains well-being.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: In intimate partnerships, the idea of \"姑舍是\" warns against overbearing attachment. Giving space and allowing each other to grow independently can strengthen mutual respect and reduce resentment.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: Professionals are reminded that not every opportunity or project deserves pursuit. Recognizing when a venture is detrimental and withdrawing can prevent wasted effort and preserve reputation for future endeavors.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: The poem suggests prudent financial decisions: avoid overinvesting in risky ventures or indulging in impulsive purchases. A disciplined withdrawal from poor investments safeguards capital.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: Within families, conflicts often arise from unresolved grievances. The advice to let go of stubborn positions fosters dialogue, nurtures understanding, and restores harmony.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Public disputes or gossip can harm one's standing. Choosing to disengage from negative social circles or contentious debates protects integrity and preserves social capital.\n\nOverall, the verse encapsulates a universal lesson: recognizing when to release and when to endure is crucial for personal growth, stability, and harmonious living.",
