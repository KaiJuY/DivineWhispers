    "zh": "这首诗的主题是对失败的宽容与坚持的呼唤。作者通过简洁的三句，劝诫人们在面对挫折时，不要轻易放弃，而是要勇于再次尝试。诗中“再，斯可矣”以反问的方式提醒，第二次努力同样具备成功的可能。此语句所蕴含的精神是：心中若有坚定目标，偶然的失利只是暂时的阻碍，唯有持续努力，方能迎来突破。诗句亦映射出一种不屈的生活态度，强调行动与信念的并行，鼓励读者在困境中把握重来的机会。最终，诗意传递的，是一份对命运的挑战与对自我价值的肯定。诗人以简短之辞，却深刻揭示了失败并非终点，正是磨练与自省的契机。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is a call for tolerance of failure and persistence. The author, through three concise lines, urges people not to give up lightly in the face of setbacks, but to be brave in attempting again. In the poem, \"再，斯可矣\" reminds in a rhetorical way that a second effort likewise holds the possibility of success. The spirit embodied in this sentence is: if one has a firm goal in mind, occasional defeats are merely temporary obstacles; only continued effort can lead to breakthrough. The lines also reflect an unyielding attitude toward life, emphasizing the parallel of action and belief, encouraging readers to seize the chance to try again in adversity. Ultimately, what the poem conveys is a challenge to destiny and an affirmation of one's own value. The poet, with brief words, profoundly reveals that failure is not an endpoint; it is a chance for honing and self‑reflection.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、失敗に対する寛容と粘り強さの呼びかけです。作者は簡潔な三行で、人々に挫折に直面したときに軽く諦めず、再び挑戦する勇気を持つよう促します。詩の中で「再、斯可矣」は反問の形で、二度目の努力も成功の可能性を持つことを思い出させます。この文に込められた精神は、心に確固たる目標があれば、偶然の失敗は一時的な障害にすぎず、継続的な努力だけが突破をもたらすというものです。句はまた、行動と信念が並行する不屈の生活態度を映し、逆境の中で再挑戦の機会を掴むよう読者を励まします。最後に、詩の意味は運命への挑戦と自らの価値の肯定を伝えるものです。詩人は短い言葉で、失敗は終点ではなく、鍛錬と自己省察の機会であることを深く明らかにしています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that failure is not a definitive end but an invitation to persist; the phrase “再，斯可矣” serves as a concise exhortation to attempt again, underscoring that the possibility of success remains intact with continued effort. The poem encapsulates a philosophical stance that setbacks are temporary, and the key to progress lies in resilience and self‑belief. It invites readers to see each setback as a chanceাৰত for growth and to recognize that perseverance ultimately reshapes outcomes. The following six dimensions illustrate the practical lessons that can be drawn from this brief verse.\n\n1. **Health**: The poem encourages mental resilience. Practically, this means maintaining a calm, focused mindset when confronting health challenges or setbacks in recovery, using setbacks as opportunities to adopt healthier habits and to seek professional guidance when needed.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships**: The call to persist after a misunderstanding encourages open communication. Couples and friends are urged to revisit the conversation, apologize when appropriate, and approach conflicts with renewed empathy, thereby strengthening emotional bonds.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition**: In professional settings, the verse reminds us that rejections or project failures are not final verdicts. Continued effort—refining skills, revising strategies, and applying for new opportunities—ultimately reshapes one’s trajectory and can lead to promotions or successful ventures.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances**: When facing monetary loss, the poem’s message advises reassessment rather than resignation. Re‑evaluating financial plans, diversifying income streams, and learning from past mistakes can turn a temporary setback into long‑term fiscal stability.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony**: The poem’s insistence on action and belief mirrors family dynamics. After a dispute, family members are encouraged to return to dialogue, reconcile differences, and work collectively toward a shared goal, thereby restoring harmony.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation**: Building social capital is portrayed as a gradual process of persistence. By repeatedly engaging in community service, sharing expertise, or consistently practicing professionalism, one can earn trust and a respected reputation over time.",
