    "zh": "這首詩的主題是堅持與不變的力量。詩中以「仍舊貫」作喻，表達在逆境中保持原有方向的重要性。作者提醒我們，面對困難時不必急於改變策略，而應堅守已經奠定的基礎，讓時間與機會成為轉機。持續的堅持會累積成長的資本，最終突破困境。詩意還隱含了對變革的懼怕與對傳統的尊重，提醒我們在進步與守護之間取得平衡。對於個人而言，這種穩定性是長期成功的關鍵；對於社會而言，堅守原則能防止盲目追逐短期利益而忽略核心價值。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the power of perseverance and constancy. In the verse, 'still through' metaphorically conveys the importance of maintaining one’s original direction amid adversity. The author reminds us not to rush to change strategy when faced with difficulties, but rather to uphold the foundations already laid, allowing time and opportunity to become turning points. Continuous perseverance builds capital for growth and ultimately breaks through challenges. The poem also subtly reflects fear of change and respect for tradition, urging a balance between progress and protection. For individuals, this steadiness is key to long‑term success; for society, holding principles safeguards against blind pursuit of short‑term gains at the expense of core values.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、忍耐と不変の力です。詩中の『仍舊貫』は、逆境の中で自らの原点を保ち続ける重要性を比喩的に示しています。筆者は、困難に直面したときに急いで戦略を変えるべきではなく、既に築かれた基盤を守り、時間と機会が転機になることを許すべきだと指摘します。継続的な忍耐は成長の資本を蓄積し、最終的に困難を突破します。詩はまた、変化への恐れと伝統への尊重を微妙に示し、進歩と保護のバランスを取るよう促しています。個人にとってはこの安定性が長期的成功の鍵となり、社会にとっては原則を守ることで短期的利益に盲目になり、核心価値を失う危険を防ぐことができます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a meditation on perseverance amid adversity, encouraging steadfastness and resistance to needless change. The verses extol the virtue of maintaining one’s original path—symbolized by the phrase “still through”—when confronted with obstacles, and emphasize that time and patience are the true catalysts for transformation. By preserving established foundations, the poem suggests that gradual progress can outweigh abrupt, potentially destabilizing alterations. It also subtly acknowledges a fear of change and a reverence for tradition, urging a measured balance between innovation and stability.\n\n1. Health: Sticking to healthy habits even when progress seems slow reinforces resilience. Avoid abrupt changes in diet or exercise; steady adaptation is more sustainable. Mindful persistence can convert minor setbacks into lasting improvement.\n2. Love and Relationships: Holding firm to core values and communication patterns fosters trust. Rather than pivoting quickly in response to disagreements, maintaining consistent dialogue encourages deeper connection. Patience with partners allows relational growth.\n3. Career and Ambition: Consistency in skill development and project execution builds credibility. Steady efforts often lead to breakthroughs that sudden shifts cannot achieve. Maintaining a clear, long‑term vision steadies career momentum.\n4. Wealth and Finances: Avoid impulsive financial decisions; incremental saving and disciplined investment yield compound gains. Keeping a stable budget respects the idea that persistence outpaces rash spending. Over time, steady growth outweighs short‑term gains.\n5. Family and Harmony: Upholding family traditions and established routines supports emotional stability. A steady approach to conflict resolution reinforces mutual respect. Consistency in presence and support strengthens familial bonds.\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Sustained engagement in community or professional networks builds a solid reputation. Consistency in integrity and follow‑through fosters trust among peers. Gradual, reliable contributions become the cornerstone of lasting influence.",
