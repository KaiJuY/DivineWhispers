    "zh": "這首詩的主題是以相反之道揭示人心與事物的真實面貌。詩句「其所厚者薄，其所薄者厚」指出，外表看似濃厚的事物往往實際上很薄弱；相反，表面看似輕薄的東西卻可能內在深厚。此語提醒人們不要被外在表象所迷惑，而應從內在本質去審視。對於婚姻而言，若當初以為對方厚重卻實際缺乏深度，未必能夠維持長久；相反，最初看似平淡的伴侶可能因內在的堅韌與理解而成為最終的緣分。因此，該籤勸勉你在尋找伴侶時，要以寬闊的心態看待對方的內在價值，而非僅以外表或表象來衡量。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the revelation of true nature through opposite perspectives. The line 'What is considered thick by others is actually thin, and what is considered thin by others is actually thick' indicates that what appears substantial outwardly often lacks depth, while what seems light may contain profound substance. It reminds us not to be deceived by external appearances, but to judge based on inner essence. Regarding marriage, a partner who initially seems strong but actually lacks depth may not sustain a lasting relationship; conversely, a partner who appears modest can become the ultimate bond due to inner resilience and understanding. Thus, the fortune advises you to look beyond the surface when choosing a spouse, assessing internal value rather than just outward form.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、逆の観点で物事の真実を暴露することにあります。『その所厚者薄、その所薄者厚』という句は、外見上厚みがあると見られるものは実際には薄いことが多く、逆に薄く見えるものには深い内面が隠されていることを示します。外見に騙されず、内なる本質で判断することの重要性を教えてくれます。結婚に関しては、最初は強く見える相手が実際には深みがなく長続きしないこともある一方、最初は軽く見える相手が内なる粘り強さと理解力で最終的に運命の絆になる可能性があるという教訓です。従って、伴侶を選ぶ際は表面だけでなく内面の価値を見極めるよう勧められます。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a profound reminder that external appearances can be deceptive, and that true worth lies beneath the surface. The line “What is considered thick by others is actually thin, and what is considered thin by others is actually thick” invites readers to look beyond superficial judgments and to recognize the hidden depth within people, situations, and opportunities. In the context of this particular fortune, the message applies to personal relationships, especially marriage, urging individuals to value inner qualities over outward grandeur, and to remain open to unexpected and rewarding connections that may not be immediately apparent.\n\n1. Health\nIn matters of health, the poem suggests that seemingly robust vitality may mask underlying weakness, and that a quiet, unassuming state can conceal resilience. Therefore, one should monitor subtle signals rather than rely solely on visible vigor, and cultivate steady, inner strength.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nThe poem warns against judging partners by their apparent charisma or material success. Instead, one should assess mutual understanding, loyalty, and depth of commitment, as these hidden qualities can lead to lasting partnership.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nCareer opportunities that appear abundant might actually be shallow or unsustainable. Conversely, roles that seem modest may offer rich growth, stability, and intrinsic satisfaction. Seek positions that align with core values rather than surface allure.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial gains that seem large may be fragile and short‑lived, while modest savings can accumulate substantial wealth over time. Focus on prudent budgeting and long‑term planning instead of flashy, high‑risk ventures.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily dynamics that appear harmonious on the surface may harbor unresolved tensions, whereas quiet households can foster true harmony through open communication and mutual support. Attend to underlying emotions and nurture trust.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nA reputation of popularity may conceal loneliness, while a seemingly quiet individual may possess strong, genuine networks. Value authentic relationships over superficial social standing, and build connections grounded in shared values.",
