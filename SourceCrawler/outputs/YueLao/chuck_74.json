    "en": "This poem's theme is the use of the metaphors 'stealing fragrance' and 'pilfering jade' to examine humanity's yearning for external allure and valuable commodities, revealing that these pursuits, even when carried out with genuine intention, seldom yield true satisfaction. The phrase 'yet still not obtain much' highlights that, regardless of earnest effort, the tangible rewards remain scant, suggesting that the craving for materialism and superficial beauty ultimately fails to fill the inner void. The poet warns that a fixation on fleeting, surface-level gains can impede the cultivation of enduring, deep‑seeded contentment. Genuine delight and peace, therefore, spring from inner honesty and authentic relationships with others, rather than from mere appearances or wealth.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、『香を盗む』と『玉を奪う』という比喩を用い、人間が外見の美しさや貴重な物質的財産を追求する様子を掘り下げ、そうした試みが真摯な意図で行われても本当の満足感をもたらさないことを明らかにしています。『しかしそれでもほとんど得られない』という句は、熱意を注いでも得られる具体的な報酬はごくわずかであり、物質主義や表面的な美に対する渇望は最終的に内なる虚無を埋めることができないことを示唆しています。詩人は、短期的で表面的な利益に固執すると、永続的で深い満足を育む妨げになると警告しています。真の喜びと平穏は、見た目や富ではなく、内なる正直さと他者との真摯な関係から生まれるのです。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the speaker reflects on the futility of pursuing superficial beauty and precious objects as a means of filling an inner void. The poem portrays a deliberate act of 'stealing fragrance' and 'pilfering jade'—metaphorical gestures meant to capture transient pleasure—yet concludes that even with sincere effort, such gains remain minimal and unsatisfying. This observation underscores a broader philosophical stance: true contentment cannot be achieved through external acquisition alone; it requires inward honesty and genuine relational bonds. The poet’s message serves as a reminder to reorient priorities from fleeting materialism toward deeper, more lasting fulfillment.\n\n1. Health – The poem’s emphasis on the lack of lasting reward warns against the physical and mental toll of chasing external validation. Constantly seeking fleeting pleasures can lead to chronic stress, distraction from self‑care, and a weakened sense of purpose. Recognizing this, one should cultivate mindful practices that nurture body and mind rather than pursue transient gains.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – By illustrating the emptiness of surface‑level attraction, the verse cautions that relationships built on superficial admiration are unsustainable. Meaningful affection must stem from shared values, mutual respect, and open communication, providing a foundation for enduring intimacy.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – The poem discourages career advancement driven purely by status or wealth. While ambition is valuable, aligning professional goals with personal integrity and the well‑being of colleagues produces more sustainable success and job satisfaction.\n\n4. Finances – The narrator’s inability to secure material wealth highlights the danger of tying self‑worth to monetary accumulation. Responsible budgeting, long‑term saving, and spending that supports one’s life goals help maintain financial stability without compromising self‑identity.\n\n5. Personal Growth – The metaphors of ‘stealing’ underscore the short‑lived nature of self‑improvement achieved through external measures. Authentic growth emerges when one confronts personal limitations, embraces vulnerability, and seeks continual learning within a supportive community.\n\n6. Spiritual Development – The central message aligns closely with spiritual teachings that emphasize inner sincerity over external rituals. By turning inward and forming authentic connections, a person can experience a profound sense of purpose and peace, fostering true spiritual growth.",
