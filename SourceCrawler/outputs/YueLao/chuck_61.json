    "en": "This poem's theme is about whether individuals are compatible in interpersonal relationships, particularly focusing on suitability in romantic or marital contexts. Centered on '嘉耦曰配', the poem reminds readers to first observe whether personalities, values, and interests complement each other when seeking a partner. If two people can tolerate and support each other, they can create a lasting and harmonious relationship; conversely, lacking shared topics and understanding makes it difficult to maintain. The verse also contains a sense of destiny: even if external conditions align, the ultimate outcome still depends on both parties' good deeds and efforts. It advises that when choosing a partner, one should base it on sincerity and communication, and emphasize mutual long‑term growth and shared values, so that future interactions bring genuine satisfaction and happiness.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、人間関係における相性、特に恋愛や結婚における適合性に焦点を当てていることです。『嘉耦曰配』を中心に、相手の性格、価値観、興味が互いに補完し合うかどうかを観察するよう読者に促しています。互いに容認し支え合えるなら、長期的かつ調和のとれた関係が築けます。対照的に、共通の話題や理解が欠けると維持が難しくなります。詩句は運命観も含んでおり、外的条件が合っていても、最終的な結末は双方の善行と努力にかかっています。伴侶を選ぶ際は、誠実さとコミュニケーションを基盤にし、相互の長期発展と共有価値を重視するよう提案しています。そうすれば、将来の関係で本当の満足と幸福を得られるでしょう。",
