  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that persistent, day‑to‑day effort and steadfast belief are the keys to realizing personal aspirations, especially in love and life goals. The brief verse “经之营之，不日成之” emphasizes that by continuously cultivating one’s efforts, success will inevitably arrive, while “日日下注功夫，勤劳扶之” urges consistent action. The poem reminds the reader that patience and diligence are indispensable virtues; impulsive haste may squander opportunities, whereas steady progress opens doors that no single grand gesture can achieve. In essence, the piece teaches that genuine commitment, embodied in routine practice and unwavering faith, lays the foundation for meaningful relationships and personal achievements.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s insistence on daily dedication implies that one should apply the same consistency to self‑care. Regular exercise, proper nutrition, and mindful rest become part of the “下注功夫” that safeguards vitality. The idea that success follows persistence encourages the reader to view health maintenance as a long‑term investment, not a fleeting trend.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – The verse explicitly mentions courting “伊人” with confidence and sincerity. It advises that one must move beyond wishful thinking and take concrete steps, such as listening, sharing, and demonstrating patience, to win a partner’s heart. The message is that relationships thrive when both parties invest steadily over time, mirroring the poem’s call for “勤劳扶之.”\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – “经之营之” is a metaphor for building one’s professional life through incremental gains. Whether mastering a skill, nurturing a network, or pursuing a project, the poem stresses that results are earned through continuous practice rather than overnight success. Ambitious individuals are urged to set a realistic pace and celebrate small milestones.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – Though not overtly financial, the principle of disciplined effort applies to money management. Regular savings, prudent spending, and ongoing learning about markets align with the poem’s advocacy for steady, cumulative progress. The reader learns that wealth grows in layers, much like a well‑farmed plot that yields fruit only after years of tending.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – The emphasis on persistent nurturing extends to family bonds. Daily gestures—expressing gratitude, offering help, or simply sharing moments—act as the “下注功夫” that strengthens familial harmony. The poem implicitly reminds that enduring affection stems from consistent, attentive care.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Building a positive reputation requires a long‑term commitment to перестраність and generosity. The poem’s encouragement of sustained effort translates into cultivating trustworthiness, helping others, and maintaining respectful communication. Over time, such consistent conduct establishes a reputation that attracts opportunities and goodwill.",
