    "en": "This poem's theme is a warning to the younger generation and a reflection on future choices. The author points out that people who are currently in a comfortable state often take this as a standard, yet they cannot foresee the changes of those who come after. The lines \"後生可畏，焉知來者人不如今也\" mean that the people of the future may not be envied or respected by those of the present; rather, they may surpass the current era in all aspects, showing higher talent and character. The author further advises that facing such possibilities one should carefully choose one's own path, focus on cultivating virtue and learning, and approach the future's uncertainty with prudence.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、若い世代への警告と将来の選択についての考察です。著者は、現在快適な状態にある人々がこれを基準にすることが多いが、後に続く人々の変化を予測できないと指摘しています。『後生可畏，焉知来者人不如今也』という句は、将来の人々が現在の人々に羨望や敬意を持たれない可能性があることを意味し、むしろ彼らはすべての面で現代を凌ぎ、より高い才能と人格を示すかもしれないということです。著者はさらに、こうした可能性に直面した際には、慎重に自分の道を選び、品徳と学びを育むことに注力し、将来の不確実性に対して慎重な姿勢で臨むべきだと勧めています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that one must remain vigilant about the future and the individuals who will shape it. The author warns that a person who is satisfied with the present may fail to anticipate the remarkable changes that the next generation will bring. By highlighting the uncertainty of whether future people will surpass or be surpassed by the current ones, the poem encourages careful selection of life’s path, nurturing moral character and intellectual cultivation, and approaching the unknown with prudence.\n\n1. **Health**\nThe poem implies that a complacent attitude toward one’s well‑being can leave a person ill‑prepared for unforeseen hardships. By remaining conscious of future possibilities, one should maintain a disciplined approach to physical and mental health, recognizing that future circumstances may demand greater resilience.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships**\nThe message cautions against assuming that present romantic or familial bonds will remain static. It urges individuals to cultivate empathy, understanding, and flexibility, so that when future partners or relatives bring new expectations, the relationship can adapt without losing its core values.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition**\nThe warning encourages a proactive stance toward professional development. Rather than resting on current achievements, one should invest continuously in skill acquisition and networking, anticipating that emerging talents may outpace existing positions and that adaptability is key to sustaining relevance.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances**\nThe poem suggests that financial comfort can create a false sense of security. Prudence in budgeting, investing, and saving is advised, as the economic environment may shift unpredictably, and those who have prepared for such changes will maintain stability.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony**\nIt stresses that family dynamics are not guaranteed to remain harmonious if current members assume a fixed role. By actively fostering communication, mutual respect, and shared purpose, families can evolve positively even when future generations introduce fresh perspectives and challenges.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation**\n popup\nThe poem highlights the importance of building a reputation grounded in integrity and competence. As society values new viewpoints, maintaining a reputation based on consistent ethical conduct and lifelong learning ensures that one remains respected regardless of the changing social landscape.",
