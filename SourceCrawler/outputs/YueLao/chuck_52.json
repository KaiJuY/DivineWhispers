    "en": "This poem's theme is about the subtle connection between success and failure and family affection, using double symbolism of mother and Xiao He to reveal the mutual reflection of destiny and the profound influence of personal choices. The mother symbolizes stability and warmth, becoming an internal guide for actions and decisions; Xiao He represents historical strategy and turbulence, reminding one to evaluate and adjust carefully when facing failure. The poem contrasts 'success' and 'failure', emphasizing that success is not a single factor but an intertwining of many relations; failure is not absolute, often accompanied by growth and reflective opportunities. Overall, the poem advises readers to pursue goals while balancing family emotions and historical wisdom, seeking harmony between inner and outer forces for long-term well-being and peace.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、成功と失敗と家族愛の微妙な関係を、母と蕭何という二重の象徴を通じて示し、運命の相互反映と個人の選択の深遠な影響を明らかにするものです。母は安定と温かさを象徴し、行動や判断の内部指針となります。蕭何は歴史的な策略と波乱を表し、失敗に直面した際に慎重に評価し調整するよう促します。詩は『成功』と『失敗』を対比し、成功は単一の要因ではなく多くの関係が交錯するものであり、失敗は絶対ではなく成長と反省の機会を伴うことを強調します。全体として、詩は読者に目標を追求する際に家族の感情と歴史的知恵を兼ね備え、内外の調和を求めるよう促し、長期的な幸福と安寧を達成するよう勧めています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is a nuanced reflection on how success and failure are intertwined with personal relationships and historical context. The verse juxtaposes the comforting presence of a mother—symbolizing stability, warmth, and guidance—with the cunning strategist Xiao He, representing the turbulence of history and the necessity of careful evaluation in the face of setbacks. It warns that success is not a singular achievement but a complex web of influences, and failure is not an absolute end but a potential catalyst for growth and self-reflection. The poem thus encourages a balanced pursuit of goals, harmonizing familial affection and historical wisdom, to attain long-term well-being and peace. \n\n1. Health\nThe poem suggests that physical and mental health depend on a balanced internal compass, much like a mother’s steadiness. When health falters, one should carefully reassess habits and environments, akin to evaluating strategies against Xiao He’s lessons.\n\n2. Love and Relationships\nStrong bonds resemble a mother’s embrace, offering support during triumphs and trials. The poem implies nurturing relationships can transform failure into learning moments, reinforcing mutual resilience.\n\n3. Career and Ambition\nProfessional pursuits should heed both stability and adaptability. The mother’s guidance represents long-term vision, while Xiao He’s tactical caution advises flexibility when confronting setbacks.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances\nFinancial success is portrayed as a tapestry woven from careful planning and prudent risk. The poem cautions against viewing wealth as a singular goal; instead, treat monetary gains as part of a broader harmonious system.\n\n5. Family and Harmony\nFamily dynamics echo the poem’s core: supportive environments foster growth. The verse encourages listening to familial counsel, ensuring that success does not come at the expense of harmony.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation\nPublic perception, like the echo of a strategist’s moves, can amplify both success and failure. The poem advises cultivating reputation through consistent, thoughtful action rather than impulsive triumphs.",
