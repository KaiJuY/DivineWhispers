    "en": "This poem's theme is about self-assessment and the wisdom of choosing a suitable partner. The opening line “帷舊婚媾，其能降以相從乎？” expresses reflection on an old marriage and a yearning for new companionship. Next it states: one person overestimates themselves, striving for an unattainable level; even if they reach it, the outcome will not satisfy. It cautions against forcing an ill‑matched union and suggests a moderate adjustment, seeking someone who fits one's own conditions. Finally, using the metaphor of a “phoenix on a branch,” it points out that appearance should not be the sole judgment criterion; one must delve into the inner essence to make an informed choice.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、自己評価と適切な伴侶を選ぶ知恵についてです。冒頭の「帷舊婚媾、その能降以相從乎？」は、旧婚に対する反省と新たな相手を求める切望を表しています。続いて「一人不自量力、妄図高攀；即使得以攀高、事亦不得称心」と述べ、自己過信して高みを狙うものの、得ても満足できないと警告します。無理に合わない結びつきを強制せず、自分に合った相手を探すために適度に調整すべきと示唆しています。最後に「枝頭鳳凰」の比喩で、外見だけで判断すべきではなく、内面を深く知ることで賢明な選択ができると述べています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that one should assess personal capabilities before pursuing relationships and avoid forcing mismatched unions. The verses emphasize that overestimating oneself and striving for an unattainable standard leads to dissatisfaction. Instead, a balanced approach—aligning expectations with realistic compatibility—promises a healthier, more harmonious partnership. The metaphor of the \"phoenix on a branch\" reminds readers that external appearances are deceptive; true compatibility emerges from understanding the deeper qualities that sustain a long‑term bond.\n\n1. Health: The poem cautions against emotional strain caused by mismatched expectations, implying that maintaining mental well‑being requires realistic, compatible relationships. A balanced partnership can reduce stress, fostering better physical and psychological health.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: It advises self‑reflection before pursuing love, advocating for partnerships based on genuine compatibility rather than idealized images. By seeking partners who match one’s own qualities, couples can build trust and mutual respect.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The message of modest ambition resonates with career planning; striving too high without realistic assessment can lead to burnout. Aligning career goals with personal strengths ensures sustainable success.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: While not explicit, the idea of realistic expectations translates to financial planning: avoid extravagant investments based on overestimation; instead, invest in stable, compatible ventures.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The poem underscores that harmony in family life stems from compatible values and realistic expectations, avoiding forced arrangements that could disrupt domestic balance.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Building social ties on authenticity, rather than projecting false images, preserves reputation. Genuine relationships enhance social standing, whereas forced alliances risk social discord.\n\nOverall, the poem offers a timeless lesson: aligning one’s self‑perception with realistic goals leads to healthier relationships, balanced ambitions, and overall well‑being.",
