    "en": "This poem's theme is about seeking fortune without haste, emphasizing natural flow and generous attitude. The opening line, 'Marked with plum, yet truly seven,' uses plum as a symbol of purity and resilience, hinting that although the appearance is graceful, the real chance is only seven parts. The next line, 'Seek me, common folk, until fortune arrives,' calls ordinary people to seize the moment and await destiny's arrival. The poem also warns against petty calculations in human interactions, as selfishness keeps good fortune away. Overall, the poem gently urges patience and tolerance toward life’s changes, hoping to welcome luck at the right time.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、急がずに幸運を求めること、自然の流れと寛大な態度を強調することです。冒頭の「梅で標付けられ、実際は七分」とは、梅を純粋さとしなやかさの象徴として用い、外観は優雅でも実際のチャンスは七分に過ぎないことを示しています。次の句「庶民よ、私を求め、吉が来るまで待ちよ」は、普通の人々に機会を掴み、運命が訪れるのを待つよう呼びかけています。詩はまた、人間関係で細かく計算することの危険を警告し、利己的になると福運を遠ざけると述べています。全体として、この詩は忍耐と寛容さで人生の変化に対処し、適切な時に幸運を迎えるよう促しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that fortune does not come to those who rush; it arrives when one patiently follows natural flow and remains generous in dealings. The plum imagery signals purity and resilience, yet the phrase \"truly seven\" reminds readers that appearances can be deceptive and that true opportunities may be limited. The poet encourages ordinary people to keep faith, wait for favorable moments, and avoid petty calculations that estrange good fortune. The overall message is one of patience, humility, and open-mindedness toward life's changes, with an optimistic expectation that luck will ultimately surface.\n\n1. Health: The poem’s advice against haste promotes mental well‑being, as frantic actions can lead to stress. Maintaining a calm approach encourages healthier lifestyles and reduces the risk of illness caused by overexertion. In addition, the emphasis on patience allows for better attention to physical cues.\n\n2. Love and Relationships: By warning against petty calculations, the poem underscores the importance of trust and generosity in relationships. When partners avoid keeping score and remain generous, emotional bonds strengthen. The patience advised also gives time for genuine affection to grow.\n\n3. Career and Ambition: The refrain to “wait for fortune” suggests that career advancement often requires persistence rather than sudden ambition. Patience enables continuous skill development and resilience in the face of setbacks. Generosity in professional interactions can also open collaborative opportunities.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances: Avoiding “斤斤計較” (small‑minded accounting) advises against greedy short‑term tactics. Long‑term financial security is achieved through measured, generous investment of resources. The poem encourages one to trust that prudent patience yields better returns.\n\n5. Family and Harmony: The message of generosity and patience nurtures familial cohesion. When family members practice mutual generosity, conflicts diminish and harmony is preserved. Patience also allows for understanding generational differences.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation: Generosity and a lack of petty calculations foster a positive reputation. Others view the individual as trustworthy and compassionate, which can lead to broader social support. Patience ensures that one’s reputation is built over time, not through impulsive acts.",
