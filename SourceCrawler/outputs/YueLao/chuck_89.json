    "zh": "這首詩的主題是愛情和關係的深度與持久性。它告訴我們，若真摯情感能長久持續，就不必每日相見或常伴相隨。日常相處雖能帶來慰藉，但若缺乏精神共鳴與相互扶持，持續的耐力將變得困難。詩歌以「兩人之心若長久」為開端，強調真正的友情不在於僅僅會面，而在於彼此靈魂的連結與相互理解。即使遠距或阻礙仍可透過回憶、信念或共通價值維繫真愛，最終導向重逢。此句提醒我們，無論是戀愛、友情、甚至家庭，重點應放在內在的聯結與共鳴，而非僅是外在的相遇。更進一步，它指出真情源自相互尊重與信任，這種基礎比任何頻繁相處都更重要，讓人明白相見與不見皆能維持愛的溫度。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the depth and longevity of affection and relationships. It tells us that if sincere feelings endure, there is no need to see each other daily or stay together constantly. Daily meetings can offer comfort, but without spiritual resonance and mutual support, lasting endurance becomes difficult. The poem begins with “If two hearts remain lasting,” emphasizing that true friendship lies not in mere meetings, but in the spiritual connection and mutual understanding between individuals. Even when distance or obstacles arise, true love can sustain itself through memories, faith, or shared values, ultimately leading to reunion. The line reminds us that in romance, friendship, or even family, the focus should be on internal bonds and resonance rather than merely external encounters. Furthermore, it points out that genuine affection originates from mutual respect and trust, a foundation more important than any frequent encounters, helping one understand that meeting or not meeting can maintain the warmth of love.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは愛情や関係の深さと永続性です。真摯な感情が長く続くなら、毎日会う必要はなく、常に一緒にいる必要もありません。日々の出会いは慰めになるかもしれませんが、精神的な共鳴や相互扶助がなければ持続は難しいものです。この詩は「二人の心が長く続くなら」という句から始まり、真の友情はただ会うことではなく、相手の精神的な結びつきと相互理解にあると強調します。距離や障害があっても、真実の愛は思い出や信念、共有する価値観で維持され、最終的に再会へと導かれます。この句は恋愛、友情、さらには家族においても、外見的な出会いよりも内面的な結びつきと共鳴が重要であることを思い出させてくれます。さらに、真の愛は相互尊重と信頼から生まれ、頻繁な出会いよりも重要であると示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that genuine affection which persists over time does not hinge on constant daily interaction. It emphasizes that a deep emotional bond, built on mutual respect, trust, and inner resonance, sustains love even when physical meetings are sparse. The verse thus serves as a reminder that the quality and depth of relational ties are more decisive than mere frequency of contact.\n\n**Health**\nSustained emotional well‑being is a cornerstone of mental health. Trust and mutual support within a relationship build resilience, helping individuals cope with stress and recover more swiftly from illness. By prioritizing internal bonds, people foster a stable emotional environment conducive to long‑term health.\n\n**Love**\nIn romantic or friendly relationships, open communication and genuine respect strengthen intimacy. The poem’s message encourages partners to value shared understanding over frequent physical presence, thereby promoting deeper, more enduring affection. Love that thrives on inner resonance is less vulnerable to the ebb and flow of daily schedules.\n\n**Career**\nEffective teamwork relies on a foundation of trust and shared purpose. When colleagues connect on a deeper level, collaboration improves, leading to better project outcomes and professional growth. The poem’s emphasis on internal bonds mirrors the need for trust‑based teamwork in business settings.\n\n**Wealth**\nFinancial stability often stems from shared values and collective decision‑making. A partnership grounded in respect and transparency can weather economic downturns, much like how enduring affection withstands physical distance. Recognizing that true wealth includes relational capital encourages prudent resource sharing.\n\n**Family**\nLong‑term family ties flourish when members treat each other with honor and empathy. The verse’s call to cherish inner connections underscores the importance of legacy, respect, and mutual support in sustaining familial harmony across generations.\n\n**Social**\nReputation and social standing are built on how one is perceived internally, not merely on public interactions. By nurturing authentic respect and trust within networks, individuals create a reputation that endures beyond fleeting encounters. The poem’s lesson thus informs a mindful approach to social engagement, where quality outweighs quantity.",
