    "en": "This poem's theme is the vitality of spring and smooth progress. The poem depicts that last night the spring grass by the riverbank just sprouted, followed by comparing the huge warship and the lightness on the river, suggesting that after enduring a harsh winter, all things revive and tasks no longer feel difficult. The author uses the name '艨艟' to symbolize great affairs, yet says 'just a hair's weight', indicating that big plans can move forward as easily as a slight force. This symbolizes that life's path becomes smooth, past obstacles dissolve, and good fortune approaches. Overall, it conveys the use of spring's momentum to dissolve previous hardships and embrace ease and health. This slip indicates that at this moment one should accept change with a calm attitude and see past difficulties as temporary, moving toward a higher state.",
