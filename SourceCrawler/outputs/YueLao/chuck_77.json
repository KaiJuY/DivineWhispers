    "zh": "这首诗的主題是关于急躁与小利的危险，强调在处理事务时须先看其轻重缓急，顺其自然。诗句以简短的格言呈现，指出欲速不得成就，见小利则会偏离大义。它提醒人们，若执着追求眼前快报，往往导致整体计划受阻；而若忽视微小利益而沉迷大局，亦可能因疏忽细节而败局。此教诲在日常生活与事业规划中皆适用，提倡先权衡全局与细节，再以循序渐进的方式推进，才能真正实现长远目标。在历史与现实中，许多失败的项目往往因为急于求成而忽略了基础建设；而那些成功的项目则以稳健的步骤逐步推进，从细节入手，以整体视角作决策。此诗亦可解读为对个人成长的忠告：在追求目标的道路上，保持耐心与远见，才能在逆境中找到突破口。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the peril of haste and the lure of petty gains, emphasizing that when handling affairs one should first assess their weight and urgency, allowing events to unfold naturally. The verse presents a concise aphorism, pointing out that rushing leads to failure, while chasing small profits diverts from the grand purpose. It reminds people that clinging to instant rewards often hampers the overall plan, whereas neglecting minor benefits while indulging in the big picture may cause defeat due to overlooking details. This teaching applies equally to everyday life and career planning, advocating that one should weigh the whole and the parts first, then proceed stepwise to truly achieve long‑term goals. Historically and presently, many failed projects have arisen from a desire to achieve instantly, neglecting foundational construction; successful ventures, however, move forward steadily, addressing details and making decisions from an overarching perspective. The poem can also be read as advice for personal growth: on the path to goals, patience and foresight enable breakthroughs even in adversity.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは急ぎや小さな利益の危険性であり、物事を扱う際はまずその軽重と急迫度を見極め、自然に進行させるべきだと強調しています。句は簡潔な格言で、急ぐと成就できず、小さな利益を追い求めると大義から逸れると指摘しています。人々に、即時の報酬に команда�",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that impatience and the pursuit of trivial gains lead to failure in larger endeavors. The saying distills a timeless lesson: rushing hinders achievement, and fixation on minor benefits distracts from the overarching goal. It urges a balanced approach, where one first evaluates the importance and urgency of tasks, then proceeds methodically, ensuring that each step contributes to the final outcome.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem advises against hastening to a destination without giving due attention to the body’s signals. Rushing through activities can lead to stress, injuries, and chronic conditions. By pacing oneself, monitoring health indicators, and addressing small symptoms early, a person can maintain long‑term vitality.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – In matters of affection, the lesson warns that a rapid pursuit of fleeting pleasures or quick fixes can undermine a deep connection. Attention to small gestures, thoughtful communication, and gradual intimacy fosters trust and prevents superficial attachments.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – Professional growth demands patience. A hurried climb often results in shaky foundations, missed learning opportunities, and reputation damage. Instead, focusing on skill acquisition, deliberate networking, and incremental milestones ensures sustainable success.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The verse cautions against chasing quick profits, which may compromise ethical standards and long‑term wealth. By evaluating each financial move for its weight and urgency, and avoiding petty gains that distract from solid investments, one builds a resilient portfolio.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – In the family context, impatience can erode harmony. Addressing small grievances promptly, giving family members time to express themselves, and making decisions after thoughtful deliberation preserve unity and mutual respect.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Social life thrives on depth rather than breadth. A hasty expansion of acquaintances often leads to superficial relationships. By prioritizing meaningful interactions and giving each connection time to mature, a person preserves integrity and cultivates a lasting reputation.",
