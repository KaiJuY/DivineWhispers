    "en": "The theme of this poem is the interaction between cloud and light, using the jade platform metaphor to explain the process between difficulty and breakthrough. In the poem, “重重疊疊上瑤台” depicts layers of clouds, symbolizing obstacles in the heart. Calling the child to sweep but failing indicates that even effort cannot remove the difficulty initially. Then “太陽收拾去” shows sunlight clearing the mist, implying perseverance and positive energy gradually dispel the doubts. Finally, the appearance of the moon represents clarity and tranquility, reminding us that after hardship, light and balance will arrive. Overall, the lines remind us that when facing setbacks, temporary loss can lead to unexpected gains under persistence and illumination, and that stagnation is not permanent; eventually we will encounter clear skies and peace.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、雲と光の相互作用であり、瑤台の比喩を用いて困難と突破の過程を説明しています。詩では「重重疊疊上瑤台」が雲の層を描写し、心の中の障害を象徴しています。呼童掃きだしても開けないということは、努力しても最初は困難を除去できないことを示しています。その後「太陽収拾去」で光が霧を照らし、忍耐と前向きなエネルギーが疑念を徐々に払拭すると暗示しています。最後に月が現れることで、明瞭さと静けさが象徴され、困難の後に光とバランスが到来することを思い出させてくれます。全体として、この詩は挫折に直面したとき、短期的な失望でも忍耐と光の下で予期しない成果を得ることができ、停滞は永続しないことを思い出させ、最終的に晴れやかな空と平和を迎えることを示しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that obstacles and confusion, represented by layers of mist atop the jade platform, can be dispelled by persistent effort and the illuminating presence of the sun and moon. The narrative moves from initial frustration, where a child cannot clear the haze, to eventual clarity, symbolized by the sunrise and the subsequent moonlight, signifying that perseverance and hope ultimately bring resolution. 1. Health: The poem encourages resilience in the face of physical or mental fatigue; the clearing of mist reflects the recovery process, reminding practitioners that setbacks in wellness are temporary and can be overcome with time and proper care. 2. Love and Relationships: The repeated attempts to sweep away the clouds illustrate the patience required to resolve misunderstandings. As the sun dispels the fog, affection and trust can be restored, suggesting that open communication and consistent effort heal relational rifts. 3. Career and Ambition: Ambitious individuals are urged to persist despite initial failures. The metaphor of the child’s inability to clear the haze serves as a reminder that early obstacles are not fatal; continuous effort, coupled with a clear vision, will eventually bring illumination to one’s professional path. 4. Wealth and Finances: Financial uncertainty is likened to cloudy skies. The sun’s light signifies financial clarity, while the moon’s gentle glow hints at long‑term stability. This encourages prudent budgeting and patience during market fluctuations, reassuring that prosperity follows disciplined stewardship. 5. Family and Harmony: The poem stresses the importance of collective perseverance. Just as the child tries to sweep, family members must work together to remove emotional or practical barriers. The eventual appearance of the moon implies that harmony, once achieved, offers lasting peace and shared contentment. 6. Social Connections and Reputation: Social obstacles—misunderstandings, gossip—are akin to the haze that blocks the platform. The narrative demonstrates that transparency, sincerity, and sustained engagement can clear these clouds, allowing one’s reputation to shine like the moon, fostering trust and respect within the community.",
