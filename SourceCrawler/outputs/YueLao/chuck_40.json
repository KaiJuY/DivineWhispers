    "zh": "這首詩的主題是尋找能與自己共度一生的良人。詩中以「良人者，所仰望必終身者也」指出，理想中的伴侶不僅是短暫的情感寄托，而是能在風雨相伴、歲月流轉中始終如一的長久關係。作者提醒讀者，所謂「良人」須具備真誠、忠信與相互扶持之品質，才能成為終身的依靠。若能在當下遇見這樣的伴侶，便應珍惜並把握，避免因盲目追求或不切實際的期待而失去真誠的相遇。此詩亦隱含一種人生觀：人與人之間的關係，最終決定於彼此能否相互理解、互補，並以相互尊重為基礎，才可延續至終身。",
    "en": "This poem's theme is the search for a lifelong companion. The poem states, \"A good person, the one you aspire to, must be a lifelong companion,\" indicating that the ideal partner is not merely a transient source of affection but a steady presence through trials and the passage of time. The author reminds readers that a \"good person\" must possess sincerity, loyalty, and mutual support, qualities that can serve as a lifelong foundation. When such a companion is found, one should cherish and seize the moment, avoiding blind pursuit or unrealistic expectations that might spoil the sincere encounter. The poem also subtly conveys a life view: human relationships ultimately depend on mutual understanding, complementarity, and respect, which allow them to endure for a lifetime.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、終生共に歩める良人を求めることです。詩では「良人者、所仰望必終身者也」とあり、理想的な伴侶は一時的な感情の寄託ではなく、風雨を共にし、時の流れの中で揺るぎない存在であるべきだと示しています。作者は、真誠、忠誠、互いに支え合う姿勢がなければ、良人は終生の支えになれないと読者に訴えます。そうした伴侶に出会ったなら、盲目的な追求や非現実的な期待で真摯な出会いを台無しにせず、貴重な瞬間を大切にすべきだと警告します。詩はまた、人間関係は相互理解と補完、尊重を基盤に築かれ、終身にわたって続くという人生観を示唆しています。",
