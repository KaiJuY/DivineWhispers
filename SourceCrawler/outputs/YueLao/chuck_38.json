    "en": "This poem's theme is a moral code centered on filial affection, asserting that a person's character and social standing arise from respect and obedience toward one's parents. If one loses reverence for parents, one loses the very foundation of being a human; if one disobeys parents, it becomes difficult to be a proper son. The verses remind us that filial piety is not merely respect for kinship, but also the fundamental means of maintaining family and social order. By upholding the parental path, one can earn others' trust and respect, thereby achieving harmony between individuals and the collective. In antiquity, filial piety was regarded as the basis of universal governance; the nobleman starts by cultivating the parental path, only then can he refine himself, bring harmony to his household, govern the state, and bring peace to the world. Thus, the poem's sayings “not having a relationship with parents cannot make one a person” and “not obeying parents cannot make one a son” deeply embody the foundations of morality and ethics, warning people that only by cultivating character within the family can one stand firm in a wider society.",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、親情を核とした道徳規範であり、個人の人格と社会的地位が親への敬意と服従から生じることを示しています。親に対する敬意を失えば、人間としての根拠を失い、親に逆らえば、適切な子として成り得ません。詩は、孝行は血縁の尊重にとどまらず、家族や社会秩序を維持する根本であると告げています。親道を守ることで、他者の信頼と敬意を得て、個人と集団の和合を実現します。古代において、孝行は天下治安の基盤とされ、君子は親道を修めることで自身を整え、家庭を調和させ、国家を治め、世界に平和をもたらすと考えられていました。したがって、詩の「親に恵みがなくして人となれず」「親に従わずして子となれず」は、道徳と倫理の基礎を深く体現し、人々に家庭で性格を養うことが、より広い社会で立ち向かうために不可欠であると警告しています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that filial piety and obedience to parents form the foundational pillars of personal integrity and social standing. The verses warn that without respect for one’s parents, a person cannot truly be considered a \"human\"; and without obedience, one cannot be a legitimate son. This perspective emphasizes that moral character is cultivated first within the family unit, and that the harmony between parent and child is a prerequisite for broader social harmony. The poem, rooted in classical Confucian thought, suggests that personal virtue, societal respect, and even national governance all derive from the proper cultivation of filial relations.\n\n1. Health – The poem encourages inner psychological well‑being. A child who respects and cares for parents is less prone to familial conflict, which can reduce chronic stress. Such harmony fosters a stable emotional environment conducive to better physical health.\n\n2. Love and Relationships – The verses promote respectful communication. By prioritizing filial respect, individuals model healthy interpersonal behavior that can be extended to romantic and platonic bonds. This establishes trust and mutual care in all relationships.\n\n3. Career and Ambition – Success at work is tied to personal integrity. The poem implies that integrity, built through familial duty, translates into reliable professional conduct. Employers value employees who demonstrate responsibility and consistency derived from filial discipline.\n\n4. Wealth and Finances – Proper conduct reduces conflict over resources. Respecting parents’ guidance often leads to wiser financial decisions and more responsible stewardship of wealth. It also encourages generosity toward family, strengthening communal financial resilience.\n\n5. Family and Harmony – The primary lesson is the necessity of filial duty for household peace. A family that upholds mutual respect avoids discord, thereby ensuring a stable environment for all members. This harmony is the bedrock upon which all other aspects of life are built.\n\n6. Social Connections and Reputation – The poem underscores that societal reputation stems from one’s domestic behavior. When a person demonstrates respect for parents publicly, it enhances their credibility and respect within the community. Such a reputation invites support and cooperation, enabling broader social influence.",
