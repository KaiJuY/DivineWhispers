    "en": "This poem's theme is about the passing of time and the decision to start anew in life. The author uses \"your past has settled\" to indicate that the past is now at rest and can no longer influence us; then says \"I speak only from now on\", emphasizing a focus on the present. The poem draws from the ancient saying \"yesterday dies, today lives\", reminding us that the mistakes of yesterday have gone, and today offers a chance to begin anew with a fresh attitude. The whole poem stresses the attitude of \"do not pursue the past, decide anew today\", advocating that after the sediment of the past is settled, we move forward with mindfulness and decisiveness toward a higher level, and thereby achieve the vision that \"there will certainly be a time of great accomplishment.\"",
    "jp": "この詩のテーマは、時間の流れと人生の再出発に関するものです。作者は「あなたの過去は沈んでいる」と述べ、過去はもう沈黙し、もはや影響を与えないことを示しています。続いて「私は今からだけ語る」とし、現在を中心に据えることを強調しています。詩は古い言い伝え「昨日は死んで、今日が生きる」を引用し、昨日の過ちが消え去り、今日こそ新たな姿勢で再び始める機会があることを思い出させます。全体として「過去は追わず、今日こそ新たな決断をする」という態度を強調し、過去の沈黙を処理した後、正念と決断で高いレベルへ進むべきだと主張し、結果として「必ず大成の時が来る」というビジョンに到達することを述べています。",

  "rag_analysis": "According to the poem, the core meaning is that the past has settled and can no longer influence our present; therefore we are urged to live fully in the present moment, to let go of bygone regrets, and to make decisive new choices that lead toward a higher state of accomplishment. The poem uses the ancient maxim “yesterday is dead, today is alive” to remind us that every day offers a fresh canvas, and that the greatest triumphs arise when we stop chasing memories and instead dedicate ourselves to new, purposeful action.\n\n1. **Health** – The poem’s emphasis on abandoning past burdens encourages physical well‑being, as clinging to old injuries or illnesses can impede vitality. By focusing on the present and adopting healthy habits, one lays a foundation for sustained energy. A disciplined lifestyle, informed by the principle of moving forward, fosters resilience against health setbacks.\n\n2. **Love and Relationships** – Letting go of past grievances enables genuine connection with others. The present‑focused mindset invites partners and friends to experience authentic intimacy, free from the weight of old expectations. New, intentional actions cultivate stronger, more harmonious bonds.\n\n3. **Career and Ambition** – The stanza invites a shift from nostalgic complacency to proactive career planning. By discarding outdated methods, professionals can seize emerging opportunities and pursue fresh goals with clarity. Commitment to new initiatives often leads to significant professional advancement.\n\n4. **Wealth and Finances** – The poem advises to abandon financial attachments rooted in past losses or gains. Present‑focused investment decisions, guided by current market realities, yield more sustainable returns. This approach promotes long‑term fiscal health rather than short‑term fixation on legacy wealth.\n\n5. **Family and Harmony** – Family dynamics benefit when members release past conflicts. Present‑centered communication fosters understanding and cooperation, creating a nurturing environment. Collective focus on new shared goals strengthens family cohesion.\n\n6. **Social Connections and Reputation** – Letting the past be, the poem encourages building a reputation based on current actions. By actively engaging in community service and professional excellence, one can reshape public perception. A forward‑leaning reputation attracts collaboration and elevates social standing.",
